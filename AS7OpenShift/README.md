This is from back when we (Red Hat) had the first OpenShift release and were finalising AS7 for EAP6.0 (still not released, so the product version was still EAP 5.x) and we wanted to launch EE6 on the cloud. We were the first company to do this. Various videos were created as part of the launch and this was one of them.
