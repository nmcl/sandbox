Better error handling.
ActivityTokenImple getImplementation should use is_same_object.
PropertyGroups not implemented.
Could cache more data in ActivityCoordinatorWrapper to delay point of actually having to create the activity (e.g., the id).
Implement interposition.
BAD_OPERATION to INVALID_ACTIVITY
call destroy on SignalSets and Actions and others!
call get_completion_status from SignalSet at the end of the activity.
