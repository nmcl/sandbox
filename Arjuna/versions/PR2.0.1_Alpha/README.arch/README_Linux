Extra notes for building Arjuna under Linux
(please read all the other README files beforehand)

The  current version  of Linux  does  not support  all of the 4.3  BSD
communication primitives i.e., sendmsg/recvmsg - sending and receiving
scatter/gather  buffers. It is precisely these  primitives  which  the
Rajdoot RPC mechanism uses.

Until (and  unless) these primitives are fully supported  by Linux, we
have provided our  own  - these are necessarily above the kernel as we
do not wish to modify Linux itself.   However, because of  this it  is
important that any communication from other  systems which do  provide
their own (kernel assisted) versions of sendmsg and  recvmsg also make
use of  the Arjuna versions, as they encode the messages to be sent in
different ways.

Therefore, when  building Arjuna  on  a system which is to communicate
with a Linux version  of Arjuna  it  is necessary  to  build  with the
-DUSESG flag.
