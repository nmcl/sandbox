This is the interface to the nameserver which users of the passive replicated
protocol must use. Because the servers and states are no longer necessarily
on the same nodes it is important that all users of a replica group use the same
primary server (because locks are held in shared memory). When wishing to use
a replica group the user should create an instance of PrimaryNS (the constructor
paramter will indicate whether or not it could be created ok). Then the user
should invoke the Begin operation on the instance created. By invoking the
FetchNameList operation as he would normally do for the nameserver the user instructs
the PrimaryNS to obtain the groupview. By then invoking the GetPrimary operation
PrimaryNS will return either the name of an already selected primary (indicated
at the nameserver) or a likely candidate for the primary. The user can then use this
to attempt to create an instance of the server. If this completes successfully
then he should use the RegisterPrimary operation to register that this is the
primary at the nameserver (this will return successfully if the nameserver update
was completed). If the server given cannot be created then the user should keep
calling GetPrimary until one can be obtained, or 0 is returned (indicates no
more replicas available). If a primary cannot be created then user should call
Abort on the instance of PrimaryNS. Otherwise he can call End.
