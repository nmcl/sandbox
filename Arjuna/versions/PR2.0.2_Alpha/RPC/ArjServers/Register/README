This class provides transparent creation and registering of replica groups. Once a
user has created one instance of a persistent state and he wishes to replicate this
state he should create an instance of the Register class. He must first register the
Uid of the object he has previosuly created (this will become the new group's Uid).
Then he should call the ReplicateState operation, passing it the list of hostnames
where states should be created, and the number of replicas desired. If this operation
returns successfully then a new replica group will have been created and can be accessed
in future by using the Uid returned by the single instance created previosuly.

Note that typename and storename must also be set before using the operations.
