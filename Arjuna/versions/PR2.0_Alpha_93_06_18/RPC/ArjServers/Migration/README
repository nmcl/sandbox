This handles atomic migration of object states. The parameters which are passed to
MoveFromTo are:
	the host where the object state currently resides;
	the host where the state is to be moved to;
	the Uid of the replica group to which the state belongs;
	the Uid of the replica to be moved.

The operation returns an indication of whether it completed successfully. A successful
completion is atomic, i.e., the state is moved and the movement is reflected at the
nameserver.

Note that typename and storename must also be set before the operation is
used.
