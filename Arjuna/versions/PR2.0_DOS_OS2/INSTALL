1. 	Installation
********************

 	Installation  of   Arjuna  should  be  a  relatively  painless
operation accomplished in the following way:

a)
	If you are running with a version of g++ then you should be able
to use the makefiles provided. You should edit these makefiles to contain
the appropriate #defines (see below).

b)
	If you are running with some other MSDOS (or OS/2) compiler then
we hope you can build the various libraries required using the facilities
which the compiler/linker provides. You will need to specify appropriate
#defines.

The required libraries are: libCom, libArj, and libObStr

If you are running on OS/2 then you should specify OS2 as a pre-processor
definition.

If you are running on MSDOS then you should specify MSDOS.

If you are using Borland C++ then you should also specify BORLAND.


2.	ObjectStore
*******************
	
	Before running an application you must specify the root of the
object store (the place where persistent object states will be read/written).
To do this you need to specify OBJECTSTORE_ROOT as one of your environment
variables.
