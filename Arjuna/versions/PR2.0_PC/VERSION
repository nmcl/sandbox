Welcome  to the  world  of Arjuna! This  source  tree contains a cut
down version of the Arjuna PR2.0 port for MSDOS and OS/2.

The cut-down MSDOS  and OS/2 port  only supports local atomic actions,
and although the LockManager class is provided, no locking is actually
performed by the system  by  active objects.  In addition,  the  crash
recovery mechanism is not  supplied as standard.  If after reading the
manual and using the code  you find a  need for any of the  facilities
which have not been provided, then send us email (arjuna.ncl.ac.uk)

Thanks to all the people who took the  time and effort to  port Arjuna
to systems and compilers that  we do not have access too and reporting
the problems (and fixes) that were needed, in particular:

David "W." Forslund <dwf@gov.lanl.acl>
Conrad Huang <conrad@cgl.ucsf.edu>
Randy S Johnston <johnston@rtc.atk.com>
David Joyner <nsysdbj@straylight.acs.ncsu.edu>
Tage Stabell-Kulo <tage@cs.utwente.nl>
Robb Wheatley <wheatley@enel.ucalgary.ca>

If   you   find   bugs  or   have   problems  please  report  them  to
