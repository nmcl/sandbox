1. 	Installation
********************

 	Installation  of   Arjuna  should  be  a  relatively  painless
operation accomplished in the following way:

a)
	Run the 'configure' script and answer all of the questions
asked. Most questions have default answers that you can accept simply
by pressing 'return'. See below for more information on configure

b)
	Type 'make -f MakefileBoot' to build the root level makefile.

c)
	Type 'make Makefiles' to generate makefiles throughout the
source tree.

d)	Type 'make depend' to install appropriate dependencies into
the newly generated makefiles.

e)	Type 'make all' to build the system.

f)
	Type 'make install' to install the public headers, libraries
etc.

	If any of these steps fail check the section on known problems
for potential remedies.

2.	Configuration Specifics
*******************************

	Here is a walkthough of the questions asked by the 'configure'
script togethor with an explaination of the required answers. Default
answers in in square brackets.

1)	Configuring for a ?? machine running ?? version ??. Is this OK [YES]

	Allows   selection of machine/os/version   for ultimate Arjuna
system  target. If  the defaults  are changed  you  are assumed  to be
cross-compiling the system.

2) Make is verbose (NO/YES) [NO]

	Controls how verbose the make process is. Accept the default
which is probably far too verbose as it is!

3)	Root  directory  of  source  tree [<path>]

	The  default value is  the  directory from which configure  is
run. This does not need changing.

4)	<OS> C++  compiler [CC]

	Which C++ compiler  to run to compile  the  system. NOTE:  the
value you enter here  is also used by the stub generator to preprocess
all future  header files. See the README file in the StubGen directory
for more details.

5)	C++ include directory [/usr/include/CC]

	The directory containg your C++ header files.  NOTE: the value
you enter here is also used by the stub generator in preprocessing all
future  header files. See the README file in the StubGen directory for
more details.

6)	Which version of lex  (lex/lex++/flex) [lex] 

	The  stub  generator  uses a  lex  scanner to tokenise the C++
header  files it reads. This  configuration parameter determines which
version of lex it uses.   If  you are using gcc/g++ we suggest you use
flex (version  2.3.7), if using Sun C++ or HP C++ use lex++, otherwise
try  lex.  See  the  README file in  the  StubGen  directory  for more
details.
	
7)	lex flags []   

	Can probably be left empty.
	
8)	Which  version of yacc (yacc/yacc++/bison)  [yacc] 
 
	The stub generator uses a yacc grammer to parse the C++ header
files it reads.  This configuration parameter determines which version
of  yacc it uses.  If you  are using gcc/g++  we suggest you use bison
(at leaset version  1.18), if  using Sun C++   or HP C++ use the  yacc
supplied  with it,  otherwise try yacc.    See the README file  in the
StubGen directory for more details.

9)	yacc  flags  []   

	Normally empty.  However if you  picked 'bison' as the version
of  yacc to use in response  to the previous question then this should
be set to '-y'.

10)	Arjuna flags []

	These  flags  (actually  cpp  defines)  govern  parts  of  the
compilation of Arjuna. You may set -DDEBUG and -DYYDEBUG as  you like.
Setting -DNO_INLINES causes all of  the inline code  in Arjuna  to  be
non-inlined  (i.e.,  real  functions are generated  and called),  This
option  is  useful  for  debugging  purposes.

11)	Arjuna specific compilation flags for optimisation and/or debugging []

	Set -g or -O or whatever here.

12)	Additional loader flags []

	Set -g or -s or -L etc. flags here.

13)	Arjuna specific libraries []

	Any extra libraries you might need

14)	Persistent ObjectStore type [FragmentedStore]

	Arjuna contains several different implementations of its basic
object  store. Accept the  default unless you  know what you are doing
(see the manual!)

15)	Root of directory tree for installation [/usr/local/ArjunaPR3.3] 

	The root of the tree at which arjuna will be installed.

16)	Is InterViews installed on this system (NO/YES) [NO]

	Some examples need Interviews to compile

17)	Arjuna administrator's email address []

	Crash recovery needs to send mail  to the Arjuna administrator
to inform him of the state of  the system.  This should be the address
of the guilty party!

18)	Mailer program [/bin/mail]

	Mailer to use to send mail. Select your favorite


3.	Potential Problems
**************************

	The build procedure should complete without incident, however,
in case it does not here are a few hints as to what might be wrong.

a)	Stub Generator does not build.

	There can be many causes for this. Most result from the use of
a lex  scanner and a yacc grammer. The stub generator is built  in its
entirety  using  whatever  C++  compiler  you specify - including  the
generated lex scanner and yacc parsers. Unfortunately many versions of
lex and yacc produce old style C code that modern C++ compilers cannot
handle or  they produce valid  C++ with  'broken' function  prototypes
(for example  assuming that yylex is extern "C" in  the yacc  output).
There are a few ways round this:

	(i) Use an appropriate lex and yacc. That is, use flex/bison
	with gcc.

	(ii) Modify the lex and yacc skeletons (/usr/lib/lex/ncform
	and /usr/lib/yacc/yaccpar) to be C++ friendly.

	(iii) Hack the generated code in the stub generator source 
	directory.
	
b)	Stub generator does not run.

	See the README in the StubGen directory.

c)	Other sources do not build.

	Probably  function  prototype  problems.  We  have   attempted
wherever possible  to be POSIX compliant. Check the prototypes in  the
files in Include/System against those provided with your compiler (and
let us know  the differences). One common foul up is in the prototypes
for 'malloc',  'free', etc. Sun in  particular like to make these  use
char* whereas POSIX says void*. We believe we  have  fixed up most  of
these errors but we may still have missed some - feedback appreciated.
Simple casts will fix most of these kind of problems.
