Extra notes about building Arjuna under AIX
(please read all the other README files beforehand)

1-	run configure and answer the questions as appropriate
	   for AIX, the answers I used were as follows:

	C++ compiler [CC] : xlC
	C++ include directory [/usr/include/CC] : /usr/lpp/xlC/include
	Which version of lex (lex/lex++) [lex] : lex
	lex flags [] : -C
	Which version of yacc (yacc/yacc++/bison) [yacc] : yacc
	yacc flags [] : -C
	Arjuna flags [] : -D_ALL_SOURCE -DBSD_INCLUDES
	Additional compilation flags for optimisation and/or debugging [] : -+
	Arjuna specific loader flags [] : -qtwolink
	Arjuna specific libraries [] : -lbsd

2-	make -f MakefileBoot

3-      make Makefiles

4-      make


Make sure that your compiler specifies _AIX.

NOTE:
	The Applications Calendar & Theatre require InterViews 3.0.1
	TowersOfHanoi requires InterViews 2.6
	The Imakefiles will need to be changed as appropriate for your
	InterViews installation etc.
