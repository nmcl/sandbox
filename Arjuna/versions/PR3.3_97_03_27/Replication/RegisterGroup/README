This class provides transparent registering of replica groups.  Once a
user has  created  the  replica view  (e.g., using  the  ReplicaCreate
class) then it should be registered with the database before it can be
used.   The user  must first register the  Uid  of the  object he  has
previously  created  (this will become the new group's Uid). The group
list is given  either at  construction time  or  in  one of  the other
method's parameters.

recordGroup will  register the group at the database. If  the group is
already present then only new replicas will be added. removeGroup will
remove the entire group from the database.

modifyGroup removes the old view  from  the  database  and replaces it
with the new one.

lockGroup is  used  to lock the group at  the database  in the desired
mode.
