This is a simple application to browse & edit through the contents
of the name server object store.

Usage:
NameServEdit

(a menu of available options will then be displayed)

NOTE:
	NameServEdit  will  only  display the first entry in a  server
group,  although it will  indicate whether  there  are  more  entries.
ServerGroupEdit should really be used wherever NameServEdit  was used.
This will be phased out in later releases.
