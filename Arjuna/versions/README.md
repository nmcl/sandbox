This directory contains the various releases of Arjuna that were made available via the computer science ftp site between 1989 and 1993.

Most versions were intended to run across a range of different Unix based operating systems, later extended to include Linux. We also extended to add support for various versions of Windows and OS/2. Though these were eventually incorporated into the mainline codebase, initially we did some bespoke versions to test how things might work. These bespoke code drops are also included here.

Note, this code was created before multi-threading was available in C++ so NOT thread safe!
