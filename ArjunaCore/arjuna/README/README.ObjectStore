Arjuna  requires a  minimum object  store to  save/load the  states of
transaction logs.   The default location for  this is the  root of the
Arjuna   installation  (the  system   will  automatically   create  an
ObjectStore   subdirectory).     For   further   details,    see   the
Administator's Guide.

If you want to override the location of the object store, then use the
com.hp.mw.arjuna.implementation.objectstore.objectStoreDir     property
variable, either on the command line, or in the properties file.
