This source  demonstrates the time necessary  to  search a  CORBA name
service for a given object as the name space increases.

First, run Populator and specify the number of entries required in the
name  service (default 100000).  Send   the output  to  a  file (e.g.,
Populator > names)

Then run Searcher and give it the name  of the file  and the number of
entries in  the  file  you  want it   to randomly  select  from (e.g.,
Searcher -file names -number 10000)
