This directory contains 3 papers (in Papers 1, 2 and 3) that might be
useful to someone starting out to write InterViews applications using
version 3.0 or later, and the code contained and described in them.

In order to build and run the demonstration programs follow the
procedure that is now described.

 o cd to the dirctory in which you want to perform the builds. Note
   that a build directory will be created inside this directory. 

 o execute   "shadow <path name of this directory> ."

   Note that you do not type the '"'s, the '<' or the '>', but the '.'
   at the end is part of the command. 

 o cd into the newly created directory in your directory that has the
   same name as the directory containing this file.

 o execute "ivmkmf".

 o a demonstration program described in one of the papers can be built
   by typing    make <demo-name>   where   <demo-name>  is one of

      CenterDemo
      StencilDemo
      PageDemo
      NormalDemo
      ResizingDemo
      ClickerDemo
      ActionDemo
      TimerDemo

   The excutables will be named CenterDemo, StencilDemo, etc.

   Alternatively, the whole lot can be built in one go by typing

      make AllDemos

If you want to try out modifications you will first of all need to
make a copy of the file(s) in question. The shadow command that was
executed earlier only created a directory of symbolic links to the
real files. To make a copy of a file do the following

   cp filename some-temporary-filename
   rm filename
   mv some-temporary-filename filename

If you want to add new files then you will need to modify the
Imakefile and rerun ivmkmf.
