CuttingEdge was the name of the soure repository in which I'd keep some of the new code under development before it moved elsewhere.
For instance, some of the early ArjunaII stuff was here, as was the early prototype work for ReplicaPlacement.

There are a number of versions here ordered roughly by the dates in which they were probably last updated. However, there's no guarantee
that the dates are accurate.
