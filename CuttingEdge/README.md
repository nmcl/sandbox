CuttingEdge was the name of the soure repository in which I'd keep some of the new code under development before it moved elsewhere.
For instance, some of the early ArjunaII stuff was here, as was the early prototype work for ReplicaPlacement.

There are a number of versions included, ordered roughly by the dates in which they were probably last updated. However, there's no guarantee that the dates are accurate.

Some of the work was developed by a number of people and relevant contributor files are in place.

Relevant licence files will also be within specific directories.

----

Note, some of the source in these directories are replicated at the top-level of this repository. However, the versions here may well be different so included here for completeness.
