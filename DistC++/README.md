This directory contains the original Distributed C++ stub generator work which was factored out of the Arjuna project and made available to students and other groups who were only interested in building distributed systems from C++.

May be worth checking out: https://www4.cs.fau.de/~tsthiel/Papers/arjuna-design-usenix-95.ps.gz

May build now but should fix it to run on Mac OS X (https://github.com/nmcl/sandbox/issues/129).
