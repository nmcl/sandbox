This directory  contains   some basic tests  of the    distributed C++
support system.

Buffer: this is  a simple  application which  sends a  Buffer of basic
types   between client  and   server.   The   server is   started   up
automatically by the manager.

Persistent: shows how  to create a persistent  server, i.e., one which
is not always started  by the manager.  This is  the preferred way  of
creating persistent servers, and relies on the manager for the initial
setup only.

Raw: this is a  similar test to Buffer, but  the code is written  at a
much lower-level to show the work the stub generated code is hiding.

Sender-Receiver: this simply shows how an  RPC can be constructed. The
receiver must be started by hand prior to the sender being run.
