I don't have a problem with defining the domains in which functionality
should be mandatary or optional as you describe. I think that at least
initially the majority of "participants" in these kinds of transactions are
going to be housed in app. servers, so it makes sense. My only worry was
that optional was across the board, i.e., in all domains. I also think that,
as we discussed in an earlier email, this optionality clause must cover the
transaction model, i.e., it's down to the definer of transaction model XYZ
to specify where transaction control can reside.
