Mark - WS-Tx is, for the most part, consumed by middleware and need not be
visible to application-level components. If a J2EE application component
wishes to manage its transaction demarcation (rather than defer to the
container) and is developed independently of the underlying transaction
protocol, that it should use the JSR 156 client API for the demarcation and
a WS-Tx coordination service should be pluggable beneath this. The Java
SPIs for the Coordinator/Participant services described in WS-Tx/Acid will
be generated from the WSDL definitions and I don't think any model jaxtx
packages need to be defined for these, although you may have scenarios that
you can describe to show how this might be useful.  Is this along the lines
you are thinking?

BTW Ian, I'm hoping that the optional protocol definition in JSR 156 will
support WS-Tx, so we should keep an eye on that.

Mark.
