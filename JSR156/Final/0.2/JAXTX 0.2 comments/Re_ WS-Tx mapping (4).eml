Hi Mark. The WSDL needs a major overhaul anyway to support RPC-style usage.
To the best of my knowledge it is not generated from Java. We have versions
of wsdl2java that accept it as valid wsdl, but modelling each 2PC request
(in WS-Tx/AT) as  2 1-way messages is not appropriate and we're trying to
fix it.

Regards...Ian

I understand. How about I take a first stab and then pass it to you for a
look before we go public?

I think that's extremely important and only you can do it.

Mark.

P.S. BTW, the wscoor.wsdl and wstx.wsdl are invalid WSDL as far as being
used in the axis wsdl2java. Have you tried them? Any chance you have the
Java they were generated from?
