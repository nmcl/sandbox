hi Mark,

just a few comments on the 0.2 spec of JAXTX:

4.2.1.2.

the names of the CompletionStatus implementing classes seems misspelled ( CompletionStatusCancelOnly instead of CancelOnlyCompletionStatus etc.)

i think it would be helpful to have both status diagrams (figure 9 and figure 10) related.

Figure 10: i would have expected that there is no direct transition form CompletingConfirm to CompletedCancelled,
               but indirect through CompletingCancel. my understanding is, that due to errors or VoteCancel, the prepare process
               will have to decide for cancellation and also communicate the cancel decision in CompletingCancel.


4.2.1.4.

there is no explanation / motivation for TxHandle. you mention a "token" but do not explain (suppose something about
TxHandle got lost here).

should i be able to suspend/resume on the basis of TxHandle, or TxContext only (currently, UserTransaction suspend/resume requires TxContext) ?


4.2.1.5

(if and where) should JAXTX  say something about nesting component transactions (e.g. SAGA, nestedSAGA) ?
say, i want to have open nested transactions, where the component transactions are realized by JTA transactions.
in how far would JAXTX provide support for doing so ?
in particular, is calling a component transaction (.e.g. in the implementation of a Participant) mapped to nesting ? how could i then distinguish the coupling between the parent and child (component) transaction (close nested, versus open ), given that i cannot pass any qualifiers to UserTransaction.start() ?

4.4.4
do we want to add a mapping to WS-T ? yes, at least discuss one.
