Summary: I started this effort when still at Arjuna Technologies as a way of trying to standardise the APIs for the work we were doing with IBM and others around OASIS BTP and WS-TX. OASIS WS-CAF came in later. After the JBoss acquisition of the transaction service from Arjuna Technologies it continued on for a bit and I transferred leadership to Jonathan Halliday when we (JBoss) were acquired by Red Hat - I didn't have time to continue this effort.
