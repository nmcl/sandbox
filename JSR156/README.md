JSR 156 code, docs and issues as up to date as possible prior to closure.

See https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=156 for more details.

Summary: I started this effort when still at Arjuna Technologies as a way of trying to standardise the APIs for the work we were doing with IBM and others around OASIS BTP and WS-TX. OASIS WS-CAF came in later. After the JBoss acquisition of the transaction service from Arjuna Technologies it continued on for a bit, but eventually I transferred leadership to Jonathan Halliday when we (JBoss) were acquired by Red Hat - I didn't have time to continue this effort. Jonathan took this forward but the technical landscape had changed significantly over the years: OASIS BTP and OASIS WS-CAF had diminished in popularity, leaving OASIS WS-TX as the only complete standard. However, SOAP-based Web Services were also suffering a backlash in favour of other approaches, such as REST/HTTP. As a result, it was decided that it was premature to push for a standard Java API in this space and the JSR was closed down.
