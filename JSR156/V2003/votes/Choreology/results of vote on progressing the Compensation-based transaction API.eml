Here is the result of the following vote:

----

"Do you agree that we should provide support for mixed participant
outcomes in the compensation transaction API, such that it is possible
to have disjoint compensation and non-compensation sets of participants
within the same tranasction?"

----

Abstain:
Yes: 8
No:
Did not vote: 1

So this vote passes in favour of adding a mixed-mode capability within
the specification.

Which brings us to the two proposals on the table.

Mark.
