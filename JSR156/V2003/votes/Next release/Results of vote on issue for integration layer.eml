The results of the following vote:

<--- start of issue description --->

"The general problem statement, which applies across all supported
transaction models is:

A SOAP request comes in from a sender with coordination and transaction
information. The recipient is a J2EE artifact (say, an EJB) The J2EE
artifact is in fact a
proxy for an Enterprise Information System (EIS) artifact (say, a COBOL
program). The J2EE proxy object needs to propagate this transaction to
the
EIS. The EIS DOES NOT have a Java footprint and needs to reconstruct the
coordination and transaction objects using the appropriate stacks.

There are a number of questions that arise:

Do we have enough information in the supported interfaces so that the
EIS can reconstruct the coordination and transaction using the
appropriate stacks?

If we assume we are working in a pure J2EE environment then is this
still a problem? Can we realistically make such an assumption?

Since the JTA does not mention this and the JCA is meant as a solution
to transaction interoperability , can we do anything sensible in this
area alone?

Do we want to restrict this problem to just the compensation based API?"

<--- end of issue description --->

Do you believe that this is a problem worth persuing for this version of the
specification?


Yes: 0

No: 5

Abstain: 3

So this vote passes: we agree to not persue this for the first release of
the specification.

Mark.
