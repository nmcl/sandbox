Following on from my previous summary, it seems to me that we have come 
well down the path of finalizing the MixedOutcomeTransaction API. If you 
look back at the class diagram I send a few months ago (the one we 
agreed to base the API on during our last vote), the remaining 
interfaces, which are specific to the MixedOutcomeTransaction API, are:

MixedOutcomeTransaction: this derives from UniformOutcomeTransaction and 
provided cancel(Participant[]), confirm(Participant[]) and 
ready(Participant[]) operations. Is there anything else we need to 
consider adding to this interface?

Likewise, the MixedOutcomeTransactionManager and 
MixedOutcomeUserTransaction provide the same operations.

One question: we are adding a getAllParticipants operation to the 
UniformOutcome API. Should this return (i) just the byte array 
representation of the participants, (ii) a list of Participant 
interfaces, or (iii) both (i) and (ii)?

In general, and without revisiting anything we've already voted on, can 
anyone think of anything else that we're missing from the API?

Mark.
