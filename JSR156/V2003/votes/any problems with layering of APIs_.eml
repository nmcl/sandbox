In environments where both JTA-atomic and compensation models are
required within the same client/application, are there issues with
layering of that support that we need to consider? I suppose this
includes: is the ability to combine both models naturally and
conveniently currently adversely affected by something in the
specification? Do we need to say more than we currently do?

Mark.
