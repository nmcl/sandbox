In addition to using the ORBInterface methods  initORB and initBOA you
should  also  use shutdownBOA and shutdownORB  (in  that order) before
terminating your  application. This  is to  allow the  OTS to  do  any
tidying up that is necessary. The manuals describe how to bypass these
methods if necessary.
