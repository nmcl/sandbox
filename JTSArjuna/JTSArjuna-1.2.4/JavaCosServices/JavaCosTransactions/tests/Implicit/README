This   is a basic   example  of implicit  context propagation.  Again,
remember that in general our objects should not inherit from Resource.

NOTE: this example will only be built when using ORBacus or VisiBroker
since we cannot support implicit propagation in other Orbs.

Server: ImplGridServer

If using OrbixWeb then the registered server name should be ImplGrid.
