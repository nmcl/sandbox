An example Arjuna.properties file is included in the etc directory
of the installation. Please examine and change this where required.

Through the properties file it is possible to change many attributes
of JTSArjuna at runtime (see Chapter 3 of the Using the OTS manual), and
also install the system anywhere.

When looking for the properties file, JTSArjuna inspects the following
locations (in order):

(i) the current working directory.

(ii) the user's home directory.

(iii) the /etc directory of the default installation

If the properties file is explicitly overridden at the command line
(using the -DPROPERTIES_FILE= property variable) then JTSArjuna will
*always* use this in preference to any other.
