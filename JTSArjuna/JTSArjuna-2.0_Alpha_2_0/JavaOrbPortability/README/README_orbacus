If you do not use the ORBInterface methods for starting the ORB and
BOA then you *must* do the following:

(i) set the  ConcModelThreaded on the ORB (see  the ORBacus manual for
this).

(ii) set the  ConcModelThreadPerRequest  on the  BOA (see the  ORBacus
manual for this).

(iii)  call init_servers  in  the client (see  the  ORBacus manual for
this).

(iv) pass a reference  to the ORB and   BOA to ORBInterface using  the
setOrb and setBoa methods, respectively.
