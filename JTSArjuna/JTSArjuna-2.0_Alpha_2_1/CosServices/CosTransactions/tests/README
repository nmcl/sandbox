The  following examples  were  really designed  as internal  tests and
consequently they're   not very user-friendly,  however they  might be
useful in confirming that your release works as expected and in giving
you some idea of how JTSArjuna operates.

Note,   the scripts runtest, cxtest,  and  intertest typically take no
parameters, and run  the test  within  the directory they are  located
within. However, if  multiple  tests are  present, then  these scripts
will take at least a single parameter,  which is the  name of the test
to run.

Before running the examples:

1) make sure 'classes' is in your path.

Run the examples in the order listed below :

In each case,  if a server is  required (according to the text below),
execute  the  'servers/runserver' script (unless  specified otherwise)
then run the 'runtest' script. (Note  that under Windows these scripts
are  suffixed with '.bat'). 'runserver' takes   the server name as its
only   parameter. If using    OrbixWeb,  then use  the putserver.orbix
script.

Local/LocalTest: Tests basic functionality  on local transactions  and
resources.

Timeout/TerminationTest:  Tests    that transactions   are   correctly
terminated when they timeout.

Nested/NestedTester:   This test  illustrates   the difference between
registering a Resource and a SubtransactionAwareResource with a nested
transaction.  The Resource will   only be called during the  top-level
transaction commit/abort, whereas the SubtransactionAwareResource will
be   informed when   the   nested transaction    terminates.    If the
SubtranscationAwareResource was registered  using    register_resource
(the default  in this example) it  will be propagated to the top-level
transaction; otherwise it will not. Use the -subtran option to see the
differences.

Current/CurrentTest:  Simple test for  current pseudo-object.  SERVER:
GridServer.

Heuristics/HeuristicTest:  Tests whether  we  can cope  with heuristic
decisions.

Synchronizations/SynchTest: Tests synchronization implementations.

Transactions/TransactionTest1: Tries to  terminate transactions out of
order.

Transactions/TransactionTest2:      Shows how       Current      and a
TransactionFactory can be combined in   the same application, and  the
transactions are unrelated.

Hammer/AtomicObject1,2&3: The sum of the two integers should always be
101.

Arjuna/ArjunaNestingTest:  This example  demonstrates   the difference
between an  ArjunaSubtranAwareResource  and the standard  OTS version.
An ArjunaSubtranAwareResource always  participates within  a two-phase
commit protocol  for nested transactions.   Propagation occurs  in the
same way, however, i.e.,   if registered using  register_subtran_aware
then  the resource  is   not  propagated   to  the  parent;   if using
register_resource  then   it  will  be  propagated.  For   each nested
transaction, it will take part in the two-phase protocol.

Explicit/ExplicitInterClient:  Illustrates    explicit  interposition.
SERVER: SetGetServer.

Implicit/ImplicitClient: This is a  basic example of implicit  context
propagation.  Again, remember that in  general our objects should  not
inherit  from  Resource.   SERVER:  ImplGridServer.  [Use 'cxtest' and
'cxserver' scripts in place of 'runtest' and 'runserver'. For OrbixWeb
use 'putcxserver.orbix' and 'cxtest.orbix'].

Interposition/InterpositionClient:    Demonstrates implicit    context
propagation   and  interposition.     SERVER:    TranGridServer.  [Use
'intertest'  and 'interserver'  scripts   in place  of 'runtest'   and
'runserver'.    For   OrbixWeb     use   'putinterserver.orbix'    and
'intertest.orbix'].

Distributed_hammer/DistributedHammer1,2&3: The sum of the two integers
should always be 101.  SERVER:  HammerServer.  Start two servers using
'1' or '2' as the second parameter to 'runserver'. [If using OrbixWeb,
use the 'puthammer.orbix' script].

Arjuna/ExplicitArjunaClient:  A  basic demonstration using  the Arjuna
API and explicit interposition. SERVER ExplicitStackServer.

Arjuna/ImplicitArjunaClient: A  basic  demonstration using the  Arjuna
API and  explicit interposition.  SERVER  StackServer.  [Use intertest
and interserver   scripts in place   of 'runtest' and  'runserver'. If
using OrbixWeb use 'putinterserver.orbix' and 'intertest.orbix'].
