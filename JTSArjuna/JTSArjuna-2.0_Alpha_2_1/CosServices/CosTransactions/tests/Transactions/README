TransactionTest1: Tries to terminate transactions out of order.

TransactionTest2: Shows how Current  and  a TransactionFactory can  be
combined in the same application, and the transactions are unrelated.

TransactionTest3: Tests  garbage collection. Will  run silently  for a
while until it cannot create any  more transactions, and then rollback
all created transactions.
