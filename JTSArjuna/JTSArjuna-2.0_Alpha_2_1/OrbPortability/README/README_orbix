To enable multi-threading  capabilities for the client and/or  server,
it is necessary  to use  the  BasicThreadFilter class  provided. This
is accomplished automatically by ORBInterface.

If you  do not use the  ORBInterface class for initialisation, then it
will   be      necessary       to   create       an     instance    of
com.arjuna.OrbPortability.Filters.BasicFilter.orbix.Init prior  to any
ORB work.
