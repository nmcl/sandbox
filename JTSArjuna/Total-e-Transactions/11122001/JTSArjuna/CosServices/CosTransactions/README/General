In addition to using  the ORBInterface/OAInterface methods initORB and
initBOA/createPoa you  should also use shutdownOA  and shutdownORB (in
that order) before terminating your  application. This is to allow the
OTS to do any tidying up  that is necessary.  The manuals describe how
to bypass these methods if necessary.
