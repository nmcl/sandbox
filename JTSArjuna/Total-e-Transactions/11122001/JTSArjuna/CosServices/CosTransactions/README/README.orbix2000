The CosTransactions.idl file which comes  with Orbix 2000 1.1.1 is not
currently up-to-date with  the OTS 1.2 specification, and  is also not
compatible with the OTS  1.1 specification. Therefore, is it necessary
to use the CosTransactions.idl  which comes with JTSArjuna, and ensure
that all JTSArjuna jar files appear in your CLASSPATH before the Orbix
2000 jar files.
