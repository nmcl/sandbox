This    example      demonstrates   the    difference    between    an
ArjunaSubtranAwareResource   and   the  standard   OTS   version.   An
ArjunaSubtranAwareResource  always  participates  within  a  two-phase
commit protocol for  nested  transactions.  Propagation occurs  in the
same way,  however,  i.e., if registered using  register_subtran_aware
then the  resource    is  not propagated  to  the    parent;  if using
register_resource then  it   will be   propagated. For   each   nested
transaction, it will take part in the two-phase protocol.

Not a remote test.
