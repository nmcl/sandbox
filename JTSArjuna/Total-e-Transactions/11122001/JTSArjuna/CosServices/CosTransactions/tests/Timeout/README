These tests  check that transactions   which have timeouts  associated
with them when they are created are  rolled back if the timeout period
elapses. They also  check that the default  timeout (the meaning of  0
for the transaction timeout) is configurable.

When   running TerminationTest,   set  OTS_TX_REAPER_TIMEOUT  property
variable to 1000.

When  running DefaultTimeout,   set  the  OTS_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT property
variable to 2, and do not unset OTS_TX_REAPER_TIMEOUT.

When   running  TimeoutClient,   set   OTS_TX_REAPER_TIMEOUT  property
variable to  1000 at the server  only (-DOTS_TX_REAPER_TIMEOUT=1000 on
the command line).  Run SetGetServer first.
