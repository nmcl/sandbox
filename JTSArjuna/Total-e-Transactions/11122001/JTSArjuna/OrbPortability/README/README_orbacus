If you  do not use  the ORBInterface/OAInterface methods  for starting
the ORB and BOA/POA then you *must* do the following:

(i) set the  ConcModelThreaded on the ORB (see  the ORBacus manual for
this).

(ii) set the  ConcModelThreadPerRequest  on the  BOA (see the  ORBacus
manual for this).

(iii)  call init_servers  in  the client (see  the  ORBacus manual for
this).

(iv)    pass   a    reference   to    the   ORB    and    BOA/POA   to
ORBInterface/OAInterface using  the setOrb and  setBoa/setPoa methods,
respectively.
