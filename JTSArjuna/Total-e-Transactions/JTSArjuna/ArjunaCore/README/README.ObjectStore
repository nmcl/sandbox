JTSArjuna requires a  minimum object store to save/load  the states of
transaction  logs and AIT  created objects.  The default  location for
this  is the  root  of  the JTSArjuna  installation  (the system  will
automatically  create  an   ObjectStore  subdirectory).   For  further
details, see the Administator's Guide.

If you want to override the location of the object store, then use the
OBJECTSTORE_DIR property  variable, either on the command  line, or in
the properties file.
