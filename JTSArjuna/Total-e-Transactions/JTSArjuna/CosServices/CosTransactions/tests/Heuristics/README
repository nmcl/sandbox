This tests the heuristic capabilities of the OTS.

Note: do not try this test with a transaction manager, i.e., make sure
OTS_TRANSACTION_MANAGER is *not* set in your environment.

Not a remote test. Will cause memory leaks since if we get a heuristic
we do not remove the transaction information.
