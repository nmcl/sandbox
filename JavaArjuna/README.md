v0.1.0 version is an attempt to recreate the original from current
sources. Since the original JavaArjuna was not based on Gandiva (as
far as I can recall), I haven't gone down that route. Does include some
extensions that were not present in the real version and I may remove
them later. https://github.com/nmcl/sandbox/issues/113

v1.0.0.version is not the original source or binary but some partial
installation of the 1.0.0 release which was based on some ArjunaII
work, specifically Gandiva.

See specific READMEs in the sub-directories for further information.
