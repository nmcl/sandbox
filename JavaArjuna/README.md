v1.0.0.version is not the original source or binary but some partial
installation of the 1.0.0 release which was based on some ArjunaII
work, specifically Gandiva.

v0.1.0 version is an attempt to recreate the original from current
sources. Since the original JavaArjuna was not based on Gandiva (as
far as I can recall), I haven't gone down that route.
