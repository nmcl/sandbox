 * specific COMPILER (eg Cfront, gcc etc)
 * These flags are passed on to the compiler when building Arjuna
 *
 * Defines preceded by STUBGEN_ are always quoted strings and are used
 * by the stub generator IFF the header file is processed with something
 * other than the standard C++ compiler (we assume that the standard C++
 * compiler would set these flags itself)
 *
 * Examples:
 *   #define COMPILER_SPECIFIC_FLAGS -DHAVE_LONG_LONG
 *   #define STUBGEN_CC_FLAGS "-DHAVE_LONG_LONG"
