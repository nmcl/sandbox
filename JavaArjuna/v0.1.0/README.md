This is not the original JavaArjuna but something I tried to recreate
from current sources and memory.

Should be the basis of this paper: http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/research/pubs/trs/papers/651.pdf

Differences to the original:

- The build system is not going to be exactly the same as I had in the
1995/1996 build but that was never the importsant part of the system.

- Some of rhe code was updated with bug fixes, new features etc.
