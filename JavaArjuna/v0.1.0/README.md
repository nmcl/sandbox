This is not the original JavaArjuna but something I tried to recreate
from current sources and memory. The baseline source is the earliest
version of JTSArjuna I could find.

Differences to the original:

- The build system is not going to be exactly the same as I had in the
1995/1996 build but that was never the importsant part of the system.

- Some of rhe code was updated with bug fixes, new features etc.

- The package names are going to be closer to JTSArjuna than they were
  in the original code simply because I can't recall what I used orignally.
