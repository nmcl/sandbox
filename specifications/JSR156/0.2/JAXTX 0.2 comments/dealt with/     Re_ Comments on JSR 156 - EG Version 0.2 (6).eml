Regarding support in a J2EE client environment, I'm suggesting that JSR156
should introduce no new mandatory support of anything in the J2EE client,
only optional support for UserXMLTransaction. Again, this follows the J2EE
pattern established for JTA where JTA support is not required in the client
or applet containers - see J2EE 1.3 spec, table J2EE.6-1.
I think its fine for the JSR to propose thet UserXMLTransaciton (minus the
3 operations discussed) is mandatory in the EJB and web containers (to be
compliant with the JSR).


> OK. Any suggestion for the exception?
(InvalidTransactionDomainException?)
Sounds good.

This is pretty much what I had in mind, so I'm happy with this split.

I'm not sure I understand what your proposing: are you suggesting that what
we currently call UserTransaction (with suspend/resume removed) is
optional?
With the split of suspend/resume into another class, I can see that this
other class should be optional in the client architecture, but not the
mainline user transaction interface.

I agree, and the original statement certainly didn't mean that.

In my sugegsted modification when I said "implementation" I actually meant
"transaction implementation", so this should be consistent with what you
are
suggesting.

OK. Any suggestion for the exception? (InvalidTransactionDomainException?)

Mark.
