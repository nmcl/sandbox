<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Arjuna System</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>Arjuna is an object-oriented programming system that
dramatically simplifies the process of developing reliable distributed
applications.  Arjuna allows programmers to focus on application
functionality by providing a complete set of tools that takes care of
well known problems encountered in programming distributed
applications (such as differences between machine architectures, lack
of centralised control and preserving consistency despite machine
crashes).</P>
<P>Distributed Arjuna applications operate using a traditional
client-server model and can execute in a heterogeneous environment.
Reliability is obtained through full support for distributed nested
atomic transactions that operate on user-defined C++ objects.  Arjuna
objects can be made persistent and replicated to ensure high
availability.</P>
<P>The system is entirely implemented in standard C++ and makes
extensive use of the inheritance capabilities of the language to
provide user-defined C++ objects with the properties of: persistence,
recoverability, and concurrency control.  Other Arjuna system
components implement atomic transactions, object clustering, object
replication mechanisms, and distribution.</P>
<P>Arjuna is the outcome of more than 10 years of research on
reliable distributed computing at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne
and has been used both as a research tool and for building dependable
applications.</P>
<H2>Current status</H2>
<P>The Arjuna system is being used for both research and teaching,
within Department of Computing Science, and throughout the world. The
Arjuna system is also starting to be used within commercial software.
Arjuna is highly portable and currently runs on most Unix
platforms.</P>
<P>The Arjuna system is being modified to be Object Transaction
Service (OTS) compliant.  A port to Windows-NT of the Arjuna system is
underway.</P>
