<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>Arjuna is an object-oriented programming system that
dramatically simplifies the process of developing reliable distributed
applications.  Arjuna allows programmers to focus on application
functionality by providing a complete set of tools that takes care of
well known problems encountered in programming distributed
applications (such as differences between machine architectures, lack
of centralised control and preserving consistency despite machine
crashes).</P>
<P>Distributed Arjuna applications operate using a traditional
client-server model and can execute in a heterogeneous environment.
Reliability is obtained through full support for distributed nested
atomic transactions that operate on user-defined C++ objects.  Arjuna
objects can be made persistent and replicated to ensure high
availability.</P>
<P>The system is entirely implemented in standard C++ and makes
extensive use of the inheritance capabilities of the language to
provide user-defined C++ objects with the properties of: persistence,
recoverability, and concurrency control.  Other Arjuna system
components implement atomic transactions, object replication
mechanisms, and distribution and thread support.</P>
<P>Arjuna is highly portable and currently runs on most Unix
platforms. A port to Windows-NT is underway.</P>
<P>Arjuna is the outcome of more than 10 years of research on
reliable distributed computing at the University of Newcastle of Tyne
and has been used both as a research tool and for building dependable
applications.  For the last two years it has been used to support the
online registration of all of the students at the University.  In this
guise it maintains a highly available fully consistent triplicated 
objectstore containing details of all students that could be accessed
from anywhere on campus using PC and Macintosh front-ends.</P>
<H2>Arjuna and OMG Standards</H2>
<P>Future distributed computing applications are expected to be
compliant with emerging standards from Object Management Group.  The
main standard is CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
Architecture). Two CORBA standards are of particular relevance: (i)
distributed applications are expected to run on operating system
independent 'middleware' software called Object Request Broker (ORB);
and (ii) Object Transaction Service (OTS) standard is expected to be
used for accessing and manipulating shared information (e.g., customer
account in a database).</P>
<P>Arjuna implements much of the CORBA OTS functionality. Some
development work is necessary to make Arjuna OTS compliant and make it
run over an ORB. We are currently working on making an OTS version of
Arjuna. It is worth noting that Arjuna also implements other CORBA
services such as Concurrency Control, Recovery, Externalisation, and
Persistence that will be required by any OTS compliant
implementation.</P>
<P>Our approach is to make OTS/Arjuna capable of running on a wide
variety of ORBs. A beta release of OTS/Arjuna (currently planned for
Orbix, Chorus/Cool among others) is scheduled for December 1996.</P>
<H2>Concluding Remarks</H2>
<P>An OTS version of Arjuna will offer many advantages when compared
to other such products. Because Arjuna's internal structure is
object-oriented, it is relatively easy to customize Arjuna to suit
specific application requirements.  For example, Arjuna can be easily
customized to control transactions in a multi-vendor environment.
Arjuna's advanced object-level replication mechanisms operate at any
level of granularity and provide complete control over object
availability. This facility - which is central to the provision of
highly available services- is not yet available on any commercial
products.</P>
