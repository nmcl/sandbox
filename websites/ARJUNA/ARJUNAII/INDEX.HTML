<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>ArjunaII is an object-oriented programming system that provides a set
of tools for the construction of fault-tolerant distributed
applications. The system is constructed using strong separation of
interface for implementations.  This allows the interface to services
within ArjunaII to have multiple implementations.</P>
<P>ArjunaII is constructed out of a set of modules. Each module
providing interface to services and/or a set of implementations for
those services.</P>
<P>Some of the module within ArjunaII are listed below:</P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Gandiva</I> provides support the construction of software that
exploits the strong seperation of interface form implementation. It
also provides support for the module construction of a software.</LI>
<LI><I>Dharma</I> provides support for construction of application
which contain "Atomic Object" and "Atomic Actions"
(transactions).</LI>
<P>Distribution</P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Dispatchers</I> provides interface to support of building up
hierarchies of RPC protocols.</LI>
<LI><I>RajdootII</I> provides an implemenation of a RPC protocol.</LI>
<LI><I>Sandesh</I> provides ?</LI>
<LI><I>Veda</I> provides ?</LI>
</UL>
<LI><I>ETHarness</I> provides support for the uses of "Embedded Tk",
which allows the easy construction of graphical user interfaces
(GUI).</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Current status</H2>

<P>The implementation of the Gandiva, Dharma and other modules is
completed, and the construction of support tools and itegration of
distribution is currently being undertaken.</P>
