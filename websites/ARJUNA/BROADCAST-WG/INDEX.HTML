<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>Explosive growth in the use of tools and services for searching and
accessing information available over the Internet coupled with
advances in communications technology are opening up a wide class of
new applications ranging from home entertainment to electronic
commerce. Thus, large-scale distributed computing systems (LSDCS)
comprising several thousands to millions of individual computer
systems (nodes) are rapidly coming into existence.</P>
<P>The main objective of the Working Group (WG) is to create a forum
where principles and practice of designing and implementing LSDCS can
be discussed and new ideas and practical experience shared. The WG
activities will focus on research issues concerned with the
development of software technology for the creation of network
services for information sharing. The WG will run for three years
starting from May 1996.</P>
<P>All the academic members of the Broadcast-WG have worked together
on Project 6360 on LSDCS, called Broadcast (which terminated in August
1995) and have built up good inter-site links for
collaboration. Research groups from EPFL (led by Prof. Andr&eacute;
Schiper), Univ. Bologna (led by Prof. Ozalp Babaoglu) and IRISA (led
by Prof. Michel Raynal) have made notable contributions to the theory
of distributed systems. Research groups from INESC (led by Prof. Paulo
Ver&iacute;ssimo), INRIA (led by Dr. Marc Shapiro), IRISA (led by
Dr. Michel Ban&acirc;tre), IMAG (led by Prof. Sacha Krakowiak) and
Univ. Newcastle (led by Prof. Santosh Shrivastava) have contributed to
the practice of designing and implementing distributed
systems. Researchers from ANSA Laboratory (led by Dr. Andrew Herbert,
Chief Architect) have played influential roles in bringing distributed
object technology to industry and contributing to the development of
standards (through their involvement with OMG, TINA etc.). Researchers
from Chorus Syst&egrave;mes (led by Dr. Michel Gien, technical director),
are one of the worlds leading suppliers of microkernel technology. The
Consortium as a whole thus represents a group of researchers active in
both the theory and practice of distributed systems; this is its major
strength.</P>
<P>Closed workshop will be organised around a small set of
topics. Industrial partners of the WG will provide the industrial
perspective on the research work and its relevance to specific
application requirements. Workshops will contain application specific
sessions, such as: fault tolerance in telecommunication systems,
bringing distributed object technology to the World Wide Web, and
microkernel support for responsive services. Open workshops will also
be organised to act as a forum for presenting the latest research
results, technological developments and trends in the area of
LSDCS. Invitations to the open workshop will be sent to the scientific
community (specially to members of related projects and the Research
Network on Distributed Computing Architectures, CaberNet), to
industrials groups, and to the EU. The WG will also organise European
Research Seminar on Advances in Distributed Systems (ERSADS). This
Seminar will combine an Advanced School and a Research Workshop, and
is intended to be a major European forum for interchange between
students, junior researchers, and professionals in the area of
Distributed Systems. The 2nd ERSADS was held in March 1997 in Zinal,
Switzerland.</P>
