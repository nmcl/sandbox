<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>The objective of the C3DS project is to exploit distributed object
technology to create a framework for complex service provisioning. By
complex service provisioning we primarily mean the ability to compose
a given service out of existing ones as well as the ability to
exercise dynamic control over the execution of the service. Mechanisms
will be needed to dynamically add, extend, remove or move component
services in a dependable and predictable manner (service level
requirements). At the same time, end users, most of whom will not be
programmers, must be able to specify, create, configure and manage
services easily (end user requirements).</P>
<P>The C3DS approach to building a framework for complex service
provisioning, unlike other approaches, will be based on unifying three
technologies: software architecture based development environments,
software agents and transactional workflow management systems.</P>
<P>C3DS will achieve its objective by: (a) developing Architecture
Description Language (ADL)-based tools and techniques for the
specification of the software architecture of complex services, and
for the construction of services through combination of components;
and, (b) integrating agent and workflow technologies for the
development of a distributed Task Control and Coordination Service
(TCCS) platform that will provide the basic infrastructure for the
deployment of software agents and control and coordination of service
provisioning activities. The features of the ADL will be expressive
enough to permit descriptions of inter-task dependencies and
coordination as expressed in workflow scripts and agent programs
thereby providing a unified way to build agent and workflow based
systems.  To achieve interoperability in a heterogeneous environment,
the TCCS platform will make use of the object request broker (ORB)
middleware and CORBA services, such as object transaction service, to
support a novel dependable workflow execution environment using
flexible transactions composed of transactional and non-transactional
activities. The Project will construct demonstrator applications to
evaluate the approach.</P>
