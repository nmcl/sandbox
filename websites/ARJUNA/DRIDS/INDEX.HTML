<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>The topic of disaster recovery is a very wide ranging subject area.
Although on the surface one requirement can be stated quite as simply
as 'techniques for recovering the state of the system just before a
disaster that led to the failure of the entire computer system',
translating this requirement into computer programs that perform
automatic disaster recovery is not straightforward.</P>
<P>There is a large category of distributed applications that use
(process, object) replication for availability. A large part of the
effort involved in crafting these systems lies in maintaining the
cardinality of the set of replicas. For example in primary-secondary
replication, in the event that one component crashes, it is necessary
to create a replacement on some operational node and hence maintain
the cardinality of the set of processes to two. If the failed
component is a secondary, then it is replaced. In the event of a
primary failing the existing secondary is promoted to primary status
and a new secondary created.</P>
<P>In systems where components may fail and be recreated in other
places, the internal composition of the set of a component group
(referred to as a unit) may be seen to `walk' over a number of
machines during normal system operation. Unit failure is a
disaster. Disaster recovery requires that once sufficient components
belonging to the unit have restarted, the unit should resume
functioning without further delay. It is necessary that only the
components belonging to the last unit configuration before the unit
failure be part of the post-disaster unit configuration. Thus an
algorithm is required which a component can execute to determine
whether it belonged to the last unit configuration.</P>
<P>The project has developed such an algorithm and is currently
implementing it on a specific platform.</P>
