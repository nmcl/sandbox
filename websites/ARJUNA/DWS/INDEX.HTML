<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>Existing Web protocols and servers provide little support for
implementing more sophisticated and critical interactive applications,
such as many of those needed for electronic commerce. The most obvious
current technological problems are concerned with achieving secure and
reliable provision of the basic existing Web facilities for
information publishing and simple forms-based input. (For example, one
highly visible problem is that of broken links between documents
caused by lack of referential integrity within the current Web
implementation.) A more fundamental problem concerns the fact that
current Web technology provides no support for transactions.  A
transactional facility would meet the much needed requirement of
preserving consistency of shared information maintained within Web
resources despite concurrent access and failures (such as computer
crashes).</P>
<P>This project is focusing on bringing distributed object technology
to the Web, concentrating in particular on dependability aspects.</P>
