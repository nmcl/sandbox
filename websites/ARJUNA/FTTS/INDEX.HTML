<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>Present day telcommunication systems make use of computing
technology that places excessive reliance on specialist equipment and
techniques for delivering core services of switching and call
management. It is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain and
enhance these systems to incorporate new services and functiona
lities. Continuing advances in distributed computing technology hold
the promise of a way out of this difficulty. This project:</P>
<UL>
<LI>analyzing some of the problems facing telecommunications systems, part
icularily regarding their onerous reliability requirements.</LI>
<LI>examining the application of distributed objects in structuring call
processing software.</LI>
<LI>examining transactional approaches to software fault-tolerance.</LI>
