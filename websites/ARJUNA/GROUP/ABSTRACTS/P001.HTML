<P><B>Abstract:</B> This paper describes a method for constructing
robust distributed programs. The method is based upon the provision of
atomic actions that operate upon objects (instances of abstract data
types).  We begin by constructing robust non-distributed programs
using the atomic action mechanism and then proceed to show how robust
distributed programs can be constructed in a similar fashion.Finally
we briefly examine other prototype distributed systems and examine
their approach to the reliability problem.</P>
