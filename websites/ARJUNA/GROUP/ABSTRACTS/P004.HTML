Object Based Systems</H1>

<P><B>Abstract:</B> One of the key concepts available in many object
based programming languages is that of type inheritance, permitting
new object types to be refined out of existing object types.  This
paper discusses how this concept can be exploited for introducing
recoverability into a system.  A multilevel object based recovery
model is employed, permitting recoverable objects to be constructed
out of recoverable and unrecoverable objects.  Simple examples are
used to illustrate the ideas and to demonstrate the suitability of the
proposed approach.</P>
