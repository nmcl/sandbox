<P><I>Graham D. Parrington and Santosh K. Shrivastava</I></P>
<P><B>Abstract:</B> One of the key concepts available in many
object-oriented programming languages is that of type-inheritance,
which permits new types to be derived from, and inherit the
capabilities of, old types.  This paper describes how to exploit this
property in a very simple fashion to implement object-oriented
concurrency control.  We show how by using type-inheritance, objects
may control their own level of concurrency in a type-specific manner.
Simple examples demonstrate the applicability of the approach. The
implementation technique described here is being used to develop
Arjuna, a fault-tolerant distributed programming system supporting
atomic actions.</P>
