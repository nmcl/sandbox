<P><B>Abstract:</B> Arjuna is a programming system which provides a
set of tools for constructing fault-tolerant distributed applications.
It supports an object-oriented model of computation in which atomic
actions (atomic transactions) control sequences of operations invoked
upon persistent objects.  Persistent objects outlive the applications
that create them and this paper concentrates on the mechanisms within
Arjuna that are concerned with their management.  The paper describes
how these mechanisms are related to the other Arjuna mechanisms
required by atomic actions for the distribution, concurrency control,
recovery and commitment of persistent objects.</P>
