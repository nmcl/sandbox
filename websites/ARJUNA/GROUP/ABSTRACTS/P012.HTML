<P><B>Abstract:</B> This paper describes the design of an object
replication scheme for the Arjuna distributed system. The design
supports K-resiliency, where, in the absence of network partitions, K
out of a total of K+1 replica failures can be tolerated before an
object becomes unavailable. The scheme chosen employs active
replication where each and every functioning replica of an object
carries out processing.  Computations are structured as atomic actions
(atomic transactions). The paper presents the details of how object
groups are created and terminated, how a group can be invoked and
object replicas inserted and removed in a consistent manner in the
presence of node failures.</P>
