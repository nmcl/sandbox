<P><B>Abstract:</B> The object-oriented approach to system structuring
has found widespread acceptance among designers and implementers of
robust distributed information processing systems.  In such systems,
state information is held within objects which may reside in object
stores.  Furthermore, if any changes to the state of the system are
performed under the control of atomic actions (atomic transactions),
then it can be ensured that no inconsistencies are introduced despite
applications making conflicting accesses to objects and the occurrence
of common failures (such as node crashes).  Previous attempts to
design a portable applications programming environment have focussed
on heterogeneous RPC facilities and common run-time environments.
Where portable RPC and common run-time efforts have already provided
some level of access and location transparency, we have raised the
level of portable, object-oriented applications development to include
persistence, concurrency control, recoverability, replication and
migration of objects.  In this paper we look at distributed
programming systems supporting persistent objects and examine key
portability features such a system should possess.  Major system
components and their interfaces are identified.  An existing system is
examined to verify the feasability of the proposed architecture.</P>
