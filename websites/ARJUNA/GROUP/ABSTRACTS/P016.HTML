<P><B>Abstract:</B> This paper develops some control structures
suitable for composing fault-tolerant distributed applications using
atomic actions (atomic transactions) as building blocks, and then goes
on to describe how such structures may be implemented using the
concept of multi-coloured actions. We first identify the reasons why
other control structures in addition to - by now well known - nested
and concurrent atomic actions are desirable and then propose three new
structures: serializing actions, glued actions and top-level
independent actions. A number of examples are used to illustrate their
usefulness. A novel technique, based on the concept of multi-coloured
actions, is then presented as a uniform basis for implementing all of
the three action structures presented here.</P>
