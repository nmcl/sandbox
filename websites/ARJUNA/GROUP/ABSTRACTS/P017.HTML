<H1>Reliable Distributed Programming in C++: The Arjuna Approach</H1>
<P><I>Graham D. Parrington</I></P>
<P><B>Abstract:</B> Programming in a distributed system is fraught
with potential difficulties caused, in part, by the physical
distribution of the system itself. By making the distribution of the
system transparent it is hoped that the task becomes comparable with
that of programming a more traditional centralised system.
Object-oriented programming systems are natural starting points for
such an attempt due to the inherent modularisation and encapsulation
properties they possess.  Arjuna is one such system, programmed in
C++, which permits the construction of reliable distributed
applications in a relatively transparent manner.</P>
<P>Objects in Arjuna can be located anywhere in the distributed system
and are accessed as if they were purely local to the application.  The
use of remote procedure calls to perform the actual accesses is hidden
by the use of stub generation techniques which operate on the original
C++ class descriptions thus furthering the illusion of transparency.
Reliability is achieved through the provision of traditional atomic
transaction mechanisms implemented using only standard language
features.</P>
