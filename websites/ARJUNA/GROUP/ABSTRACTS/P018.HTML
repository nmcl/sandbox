<P><B>Abstract</B> Arjuna is an object-oriented programming system
which provides a set of tools for constructing fault-tolerant
distributed applications. Arjuna supports nested atomic actions
(nested atomic transactions) for structuring programs. Programs invoke
operations on objects which are instances of abstract data types. In
Arjuna, objects are long lived entities (persistent) and are the main
repositories for holding system state. By ensuring that objects are
only manipulated within an atomic action, it can be guaranteed that
the integrity of objects (and hence the integrity of the system) is
maintained in the presence of failures such as node crashes and the
loss of network messages. A number of mechanisms are required to
achieve fault tolerance and to provide distribution. This paper gives
an overview of these mechanisms, which have been implemented in the
language C++, and describes how they support the object model of
computation employed by Arjuna.</P>
