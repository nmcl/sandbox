<H1>Computing Replica Placement in Distributed Systems</H1>
<P><I>Daniel McCue and Mark Little</I></P>
<P><B>Abstract:</B> We have been investigating the design of a replica
management system (RMS) which allows a programmer to specify the
quality of service required for individual replicated objects in terms
of availability and performance. From the quality of service
specification, information about the replication protocol to be used,
and data about the characteristics of the underlying distributed
system, the RMS computes an initial placement and replication level
for the replicated object.  As machines and communications systems are
detected to have failed or recovered, the RMS can be re-invoked to
compute an updated mapping of replicas which preserves the desired
quality of service.</P>
