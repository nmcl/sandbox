<H1>Programming Distributed Applications Transparently in C++: Myth or
Reality?</H1>
<P><I>Graham D. Parrington</I></P>
<P><B>Abstract:</B> Modern computing and networking hardware make the
physical interconnection of many machines simple.  However,
programming an application to take even limited advantage of the
interconnection is notoriously difficult due to the complexity of the
protocols involved.  Furthermore, real world demands insist that such
applications need to be programmed in an existing, preferably widely
available, language.  One approach aimed at easing this difficulty is
based upon the concept of transparency.  By making the underlying
distribution of the system transparent to the programmer it is hoped
that the programming task becomes comparable with that of programming
centralised applications.  This paper describes mechanisms and tools
that enable the various facets of transparency can be accomplished for
the language C++ noting what level of transparency can be
realistically attained.</P>
