<P><B>Abstract:</B> This paper presents Stabilis, a fault-tolerant
object-oriented distributed database management system that has been
written as an exercise in persistent programming. Stabilis is
implemented on top of Arjuna, an object-oriented programming system
that provides the basic mechanisms for fault tolerance and
distribution.  The computational model used by Arjuna is based upon
the concept of using atomic actions to control operations upon
persistent objects.  Stabilis aims at experimenting with Arjuna to
build large applications that use persistent objects. Such experiment
has led us to extend some of the mechanisms for persistent programming
already existent in Arjuna.  Stabilis manages objects that are
persistent, recoverable and can be accessed remotely and concurrently
in a consistent manner.  Objects with such properties have an
important function in the overall operation of Stabilis.  The database
manager can be operated either through a visual database interface or
a query interpreter; both translate commands into a series of
operations of the database manager.  All operations of the database
manager make use of atomic actions and locks to structure and control
accesses to objects.  A flexible use of nested atomic actions permits
objects to retrogress to previous consistent states. Stabilis has been
developed using C++; dispensing with the use of any specifically
designed language for persistent programming.</P>
