<P><B>Abstract:</B> A common technique for constructing reliable
distributed applications is to use atomic actions for controlling
operations on persistent objects. Atomic actions are used to ensure
that inconsistencies in application state do not arise when failures
occur or when concurrent activities operate on shared objects.  Within
such an application, objects provide a convenient unit for
distribution and concurrency-control. The properties of atomic actions
and objects can be exploited together to configure distributed
applications, without affecting the correct functioning of the
application.  This leads to the possibility of changing the
configuration of concurrency and distribution of the distributed
application to improve availability and performance.  These changes in
concurrency and distribution can be achieved by varying the object
decomposition within the application. In this paper, we show how some
kinds of re-configuration can be achieved without any modification to
client applications. The observations are a result of constructing
reliable distributed applications using the Arjuna system, which
provides tools and libraries for programming with atomic actions and
persistent objects in C++.</P>
