<P><B>Abstract:</B> Arjuna is a fault tolerant distributed system
supporting nested atomic actions (nested atomic transactions) that are
used for controlling operations on objects (instances of C++
classes). Objects are long lived entities (persistent) and are the
main repositories for holding system state; they are also the units of
replication for increasing availability. This paper describes the
design and implementation of two object replication schemes for
Arjuna. Support for replication is provided by a naming and binding
service for persistent replicated objects that ensures that
applications only ever get to use mutually consistent copies of
replicas.</P>
