<P><B>Abstract:</B> The paper presents a general model for persistent
replicated object management and identifies what meta information
about objects needs to be maintained by a naming and binding service
to ensure that objects named by application programs are bound to only
those object replicas which are in a mutually consistent state. These
ideas are developed within the framework of a distributed system in
which application programs are composed of atomic actions (atomic
transactions) manipulating persistent (long-lived) objects.</P>
