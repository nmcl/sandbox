<P><B>Abstract</B> The object-oriented approach to system structuring
has found widespread acceptance among designers and developers of
robust computing systems.  In this paper we propose a system structure
for distributed programming systems that support persistent objects
and describe how such properties as persistence, recoverability
etc. can be implemented. The proposed structure is modular, permitting
easy exploitation of any distributed computing facilities provided by
the underlying system. An existing system constructed according to the
principles espoused here is examined to illustrate the practical
utility of the proposed approach to system structuring.</P>
