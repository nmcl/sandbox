<P><B>Abstract:</B> Programming distributed applications is already
potentially difficult, although tools exist to aid in their
creation. Applications developed to communicate over local area
networks can expect to enjoy highly reliable communications with
minimal latency. However, such applications may no longer continue to
perform as expected if moved to a wide area network environment, due
to the reduced performance inherent in wide area networking.  During
application development it is often impractical or inconvenient to
evaluate application performance under real wide area network
conditions. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of
the Delayline tool which provides a fully configurable mechanism for
emulating wide area network communications on a local area
network. Delayline allows real distributed applications to be
evaluated under emulated wide-area network communication
characteristics.</P>
