<P><B>Abstract:</B> Support for dynamic reconfiguration permitting
changes to the structure of an application while it is in operation is
becoming more and more important for distributed applications.  One
use of such a reconfiguration facility would be to dynamically change
the structure of an application in order to improve its
performance. In this paper we describe the design and implementation
of a dynamic performance improvement scheme that is based on
controlling clustering of persistent objects.  Our scheme provides a
means of dynamically reconfiguring storage structures of application
objects, from no clustering (all objects treated as independent), to
maximum clustering (all objects grouped together), including any
intermediate level of clustering, to suit a given pattern of
usage.</P>
