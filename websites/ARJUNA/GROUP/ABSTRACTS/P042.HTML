<H1>The Replica Management System: a Scheme for Flexible and Dynamic Replication</H1>
<P><I>M. C. Little and D. L. McCue</I></P>
<P><B>Abstract:</B> The actual gains achieved by replication are a
complex function of the number of replicas, the placement of those
replicas, the replication protocol, the nature of the transactions
performed on the replicas, and the availability and performance
characteristics of the machines and networks composing the
system. This paper describes the design and implementation of the
Replica Management System, which allows a programmer to specify the
quality of service required for replica groups in terms of
availability and performance. From the quality of service
specification, information about the replication protocol to be used,
and data about the characteristics of the underlying distributed
system, the RMS computes an initial placement and replication
level. As machines and communications systems are detected to have
failed or recovered, or performance characteristics change, the RMS
can be re-invoked to compute an updated mapping of replicas which
preserves the desired quality of service. The result is a flexible,
dynamic and dependable replication system.</P>
