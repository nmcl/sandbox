<P><B>Abstract:</B> In this paper we discuss some of the problems of
the current web and show how the introduction of object-orientation
provides flexible and extensible solutions. Web resources become
encapsulated as objects, with well-defined interfaces through which
all interactions occur. The interfaces and their implementations can
be inherited by builders of objects, and methods (operations) can be
redefined to better suit the object. New characteristics, such as
concurrency control and persistence, can be obtained by inheriting
from suitable base classes, without necessarily requiring any changes
to users of these resources. We describe the W3Object model which we
have developed based upon these ideas, and show, through a prototype
implementation, how we have used the model to address the problems of
referential integrity and transparent object (resource) migration. We
also give indications of future work.</P>
