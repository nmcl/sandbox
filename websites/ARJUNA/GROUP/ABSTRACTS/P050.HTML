<P><B>Abstract:</B> One of most serious problems plaguing the World
Wide Web today is that of broken hypertext links, which are a major
annoyance to browsing users and also a cause of tarnished reputation
and possible loss of opportunity for information providers. The root
of the problem lies in the current Web architecture's lack of support
for referential integrity. This paper presents a model for the
provision of referential integrity for Web resources which supports
resource migration and tolerates site and communication failures. The
approach is object-oriented, highly flexible, completely distributed,
and does not require any global administration. An attractive feature
of our design is the provision of a lightweight mechanism which
provides referential integrity, and which may be customised on a per
resource basis to provide increased fault-tolerance and
performance. Our system follows an evolutionary approach, supporting
parallel operation with the existing Web, allowing users to gain the
additional benefits of referential integrity while allowing continued
access through trusted software components.</P>
