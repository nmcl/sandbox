<P><B>Abstract:</B> The Web frequently suffers from failures which
affect the performance and consistency of applications run over it. An
important fault-tolerance technique is the use of atomic actions
(atomic transactions) for controlling operations on services. Atomic
actions guarantee the consistency of applications despite concurrent
accesses and failures. Techniques for implementing transactions on
distributed objects are well-known: in order to become
&quot;transaction aware&quot;, an object requires facilities for
concurrency control, persistence, and the ability to participate in a
commit protocol. While it is possible to make server-side applications
transactional, browsers typically do not possess such facilities, a
situation which is likely to persist for the foreseeable
future. Therefore, the browser will not normally be able to take part
in transactional applications. The paper presents a design and
implementation of a scheme that does permit non-transactional browsers
to participate in transactional applications, thereby providing much
needed end-to-end transactional guarantees.</P>
