<P><B>Abstract:</B> Caching plays a vital role in the performance of
any large-scale distributed system and, as the variety and number of
Web applications grows, is becoming an increasingly important research
topic within the Web community.  Existing caching mechanisms are
largely transparent to their users and cater for resources which are
primarily read-only, offering little support for customisable or
complex caching strategies. In this paper we examine the deficiencies
in these mechanisms with regard to applications with requirements for
shared access to data where clients may require a variety of
consistency guarantees. We present 'open' caching within an
object-oriented framework, an approach to solving these problems
which, instead of offering caching transparency makes the caching
mechanism highly visible allowing great flexibility in caching
choices. Our implementation is built upon the W3Objects infrastructure
and allows clients to make caching decisions for individual resources
with minimal impact upon other resources which do not support our
mechanisms.</P>
