<P><B>Abstract:</B> We consider the issues affecting the speedup
attainable for computations that are demanding in both storage and
computing requirements, e.g. several hundred megabytes of data and
hours of computation time. Specifically, we investigate the
performance of matrix multiplication. We have implemented a
fault-tolerant system for the bag of tasks computation structure using
atomic actions (equivalent here to atomic transactions) to operate on
persistent objects, encapsulated in C++ classes. We report on the
experimental results obtained. Our analysis, backed up by the
experimental results, shows how best to structure such computations
for obtaining reasonable speedups.</P>
