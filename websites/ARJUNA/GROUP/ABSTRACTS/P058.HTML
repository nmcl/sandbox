<P><B>Abstract:</B> A well known structuring technique for a wide
class of parallel applications is the bag of tasks, which allows a
computation to be partitioned dynamically between a collection of
concurrent processes.  This paper describes a fault-tolerant
implementation of this structure using atomic actions (atomic
transactions) to operate on persistent objects, which are accessed in
a distributed setting via a Remote Procedure Call (RPC).  The system
developed is suited to parallel execution of data and compute
intensive programs that require persistent storage and fault tolerance
facilities.  The suitability of the system is examined in the context
of the measured performance of three specific applications; ray
tracing, matrix multiplication and Cholesky factorization.  The system
developed runs on stock hardware and software platforms, specifically
UNIX, C++.</P>
