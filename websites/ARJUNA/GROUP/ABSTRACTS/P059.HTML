<P><B>Abstract:</B> The bag of tasks structure permits dynamic
partitioning for a wide class of parallel applications.  This paper
describes a fault-tolerant implementation of this structure using
atomic actions (atomic transactions) to operate on persistent objects,
which are accessed in a distributed setting via a Remote Procedure
Call (RPC).  The system is suited to parallel execution of data and
compute intensive programs that require persistent storage and fault
tolerance, and runs on stock hardware and software platforms, unix,
C++.  Its suitability is examined in the context of the measured
performance of three applications; ray tracing, matrix multiplication
and Cholesky factorization.</P>
