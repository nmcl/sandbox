<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>Shadows is a distributed programming paradigm and a class library
which supports that paradigm for C++. The paradigm is one of
potentially mobile objects which may belong to large-scale,
long-lasting, independent but potentially interacting,
applications. Shadows has been designed without any reliance upon
centralised services on the principle that only those parts of a
system which have chosed to be involved in some interaction should
suffer the costs. Applying this principle rigorously has resulted in
the means to create applications which have no external dependencies
(beyond the inevitable shared use of physical resources) and are
therefore capable of scaling to arbitrary size.</P>
<P>The use of Shadows enables the creation of distributed C++
applications, and for existing non-distributed C++ applications to be
made distributed, with the minimum of programming effort. Shadows also
manages many of the related issues of distribution. For example, a
flexible naming and lightweight location system are provided as is
distributed garbage collection. Multi-level caching hierarchies may be
created for improved performance, with cache consistency requirements
specified on a per object basis if required. Shadows supports object
persistence (by reachability) and has a crash recovery mechanism which
allows the restoration of a distributed application's environment with
the minimum of user intervention. Classes which provide in-memory
checkpointing (for recovery purposes) and concurrency-control are also
available. Each feature may be specifically enabled/disabled at
run-time and objects which do not require specific features suffer a
minimal overhead in exchange for the potential to utilise that
feature.</P>
<P>The Shadows programmer uses straight C++ i.e. there are no
extensions, or restrictions, to the language. Shadows functionality is
added to a programmer's classes through the use of multiple
inheritance and the insertion of simple macros into the user's
code. Programmers operate using a familiar, simple, distributed shared
object programming paradigm.  Although Shadows is not an ORB it does
supply similiar functionality and has the benefits of being open to
user extension, simple and free!</P>
<H2>Current status</H2>
<P>Shadows has been designed to be highly portable, relying only upon
standard operating system functionality, with system specifics hidden
behind simple common interfaces. A Unix-based, singled-threaded
version is currently available. The W3Objects project utilises Shadows
to provide flexible objects for the World Wide Web.  A multi-threaded
version is under development as is a pre-processor intended to further
simplify the programming effort required.</P>
