<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>The overall research aim is the development of effective
distributed computing solutions that enable rapid provisioning of
complex services. By complex service provisioning we primarily mean
the ability to compose a given service out of existing ones as well as
the ability to exercise dynamic control over the execution of the
service. Workflow management systems are ideally suited to meeting
these requirements as they can provide an execution environment where
sets of inter-related tasks can be carried out and
supervised. Workflows are rule based management software that direct,
coordinate and monitor execution of multiple tasks arranged to form
business processes. Transactional workflow systems can be built on top
of available middleware technologies, and hold the promise of
providing both the dependability and flexibility.</P>
<P>The project is developing a transactional workflow system using
CORBA technology. The main building block components are the ORB
developed by Nortel and the Arjuna distributed transaction system that
has been adapted to be OTS compliant. A prototype version of the
workflow system is operational.</P>
