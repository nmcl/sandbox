We have designed and built a simulation package in C++ which provides discrete
process based simulation similar to SIMULA's simulation class and libraries.
Inheritence was used throughout the design to an even greater extent than is
already provided by SIMULA. This has allowed us to add new functionality without
affecting the overall system structure, and hence provides for a more flexible
and expandable simulation package. This paper described the class hierarchy
which we have created, and indicates how it can be used to further refine
the simulation package. An example of the use of the simulation package is
presented along with the results obtained.
