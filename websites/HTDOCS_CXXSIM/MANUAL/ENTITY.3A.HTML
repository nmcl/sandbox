<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This  class  provides  finer-grained control of simulation
       processes than is available  through  the  <STRONG>Process</STRONG>  class.
       Instances  of  these classes can be used to simulate asyn-
       chronous events such  as  processor  interrupts.  However,
       since  <STRONG>Entity</STRONG>  is  derived  from  <STRONG>Process</STRONG> all of the (syn-
       chronous) simulation controls are still available.

       In addition to the states available to a  <STRONG>Process</STRONG>  object,
       an  asynchronous  object  can  be  in one of the following
       states:

            <EM>waiting</EM> : the process is suspended waiting for a spe-
       cific  event  to occur.  This process is <EM>not</EM> placed on the
       scheduler queue.

            <EM>interrupted</EM> : the process, which was in  the  <EM>waiting</EM>
       state,  has  been  interrupted before the condition it was
       waiting for occurred.

       <STRONG>Interrupt</STRONG> can be used to interrupt the specified  process,
       which  <EM>must</EM>  not  be terminated and <EM>must</EM> be in the <EM>waiting</EM>
       state. The interrupted process  becomes  the  next  active
       tivation at the current simulation time.

       The conditions a process can wait for are:

            <EM>time</EM>  :  using the <STRONG>Wait</STRONG> method, a process can attempt
       to wait for the specified simulation time, and  is  placed
       in  the <EM>waiting</EM> state. The method returns <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> if the pro-
       cess is interrupted before the time elapses.

            <EM>process</EM> <EM>termination</EM> : using  the  <STRONG>WaitFor</STRONG>  method,  a
       process  can  wait  for  the termination of the <STRONG>controller</STRONG>
       object, and is placed in the <EM>waiting</EM> state. If the  second
       parameter  is <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> then <STRONG>controller</STRONG> is moved to the head of
       the scheduler queue to become  the  next  active  process,
       otherwise the application must activate it. If the waiting
       process is interrupted before <STRONG>controller</STRONG> terminates,  then
       <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>  is  returned. The <STRONG>controller</STRONG> and the waiting process
       <EM>must</EM> be different, i.e., it is not possible for a  process
       to wait for itself.

            <EM>semaphore</EM>  :  critical regions of a simulation can be
       protected by semaphores.  Only a single <STRONG>Entity</STRONG> object  can
       acquire  a  semaphore;  all others are suspended until the
       semaphore is released. The <STRONG>WaitForSemaphore</STRONG> method  causes
       the current process to attempt to acquire the <STRONG>Semaphore</STRONG> in
       the parameter. If this is not possible the process is sus-
       pended.  A process waiting on a semaphore cannot be inter-
       rupted, and is <EM>not</EM> placed in the <EM>waiting</EM> state. Therefore,
       when this method returns, the semaphore has been acquired.

            <EM>application</EM> <EM>specific</EM> : other asynchronous events  can
       be  simulated  using  the  <STRONG>WaitForTrigger</STRONG>  method. A <STRONG>Trig-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>gerQueue</STRONG> maintains a list of <STRONG>Entity</STRONG>  objects  waiting  for
       specific  events.  This  method  places  the object on the
       specified queue and passivates it, placing it in the <EM>wait-</EM>
       <EM>ing</EM>  state.  The queue methods can then be used to control
       reactivation. The return value indicates whether the  pro-
       cess was interrupted or triggered.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Because instances of this class can be outside of the con-
       trol of the simulation <STRONG>scheduler</STRONG> , deadlock situations can
       occur. Therefore, some care must be taken when using these
       objects.
