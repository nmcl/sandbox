<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This  is the main class in the C++SIM system, representing
       the simulation entities themselves. It provides operations
       for  the direct control of these processes by other (user)
       classes and also by the simulation <STRONG>scheduler</STRONG> object.

       Processes run according to a logical simulation time: only
       one  process  is ever truly active at any instance of real
       time, but many processes may be active at the same simula-
       tion time.

       A <STRONG>Process</STRONG> will be in one of four possible states:

            <EM>Active</EM>  :  the  process is currently running, and its
       actions are being executed.

            <EM>Suspended</EM> : the process is on  the  scheduler  queue,
       scheduled  to  become  active  at  a  specific time in the
       future. This may be the same simulation time as  the  cur-
       rently active process.

            <EM>Passive</EM>  : the process is not on the scheduler queue,
       and unless another process brings it back onto the list by
       means  of  one  of  the activation statements, its further
       actions will not be executed.

            <EM>Terminated</EM> : the process  is  not  on  the  scheduler
       queue  and  has no further actions to execute. Once a pro-
       cess is terminated it cannot be activated again.

       It is not possible to create instances of  this  class  by
       virtue  of  the  fact  that  its  constructor is <EM>protected</EM>
       because a <STRONG>Process</STRONG> itself represents an abstract  entity  -
       the  real entity must be provided by the deriving classes.

       The default constructor creates a process with the default
       Thread(3A)  priority  and  stack allocation. The other two
       constructors allow for the modification of both  of  these
       parameters.

       The  <EM>static</EM> constant <STRONG>Never</STRONG> represents a special simulation
       time: processes with this time will never  be  reactivated
       by the <STRONG>scheduler.</STRONG>

       The  methods  <STRONG>CurrentTime</STRONG> and <STRONG>Time</STRONG> both return the current
       simulation time. The former is a  <EM>static</EM>  method  and  can
       therefore  be  invoked  without  an  instance of the class
       scheduled to be activate.

       <STRONG>next_ev</STRONG>  returns  the  next process (relative to this pro-
       cess) on the scheduler queue. If the  current  process  is
       not  on  the  scheduler  queue  then  this  returns a <STRONG>NULL</STRONG>
       pointer.

       There are five <STRONG>Activate</STRONG> methods which operate only on pas-
       sive processes:

            1) at the current simulation time
            2) before another process,
            3) after another process,
            4) at a specified (simulated) time, or
            5) after a specified (simulated) delay


       The  five  corresponding  <STRONG>ReActivate</STRONG> methods apply to both
       active processes and those on the scheduler queue.

       If the process is on  the  scheduler  queue,  then  <STRONG>Cancel</STRONG>
       removes  it  and makes it passive. Otherwise it does noth-
       ing.

       <STRONG>idle</STRONG> returns <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> if the process is passive or terminated,
       otherwise  <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> is returned (i.e., it is either active or
       present on the scheduler queue).

       <STRONG>passivated</STRONG> indicates whether the process is passive.

       <STRONG>terminated</STRONG> indicates whether the process has  been  termi-
       nated.

       <STRONG>terminate</STRONG>  removes the process from the scheduler queue if
       necessary and sets the process status to terminated.  Once
       this is done the process can never be reactivated.

       <STRONG>current</STRONG> returns the currently active process.

       <STRONG>Body</STRONG>  represents  the actual code for the process which is
       executed when the process is active. This is a  <EM>pure</EM>  <EM>vir-</EM>
       <EM>tual</EM>  function, and must be defined in one of the deriving
       classes before an instance can be declared.

       <STRONG>reset</STRONG> is used for resetting the process prior  to  another
       simulation run. To reset a simulation, the <STRONG>reset</STRONG> method of
       the <STRONG>scheduler</STRONG> must be called, and this resets all  of  the
       processes currently on the simulation queue.

       When  invoked  by  the active process <STRONG>Hold</STRONG> reschedules the
       currently active process for activation at  a  later  time
       indicated by the supplied parameter.
       scheduler queue. It will not be rescheduled unless another
       process invokes one of the activation methods.
