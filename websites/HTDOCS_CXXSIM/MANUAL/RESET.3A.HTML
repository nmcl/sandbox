<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Resetting a  simulation  involves  resetting  all  of  the
       objects  involved  in it which will be required for subse-
       quent runs.  To reset a simulation, the  <STRONG>reset</STRONG>  method  of
       the  simulation <STRONG>scheduler</STRONG> must be invoked. This then calls
       the corresponding <STRONG>reset</STRONG> methods for  all  of  the  process
       objects which are currently on the simulation queue.

       However, there is a difference between resetting the state
       of a process and  resetting  its  associated  thread.  The
       thread  can  only  be  reset  when  it  is next activated.
       Because a reset can potentially occur at any point, it  is
       necessary  for  an  active process to be able to determine
       whether it was reset  while  it  was  inactive,  and  take
       appropriate action.

       C++SIM  provides  two macros for this, both based upon the
       CSP notion of guarded commands. Operations  are  performed
       and  a  reset  condition can be checked before the process
       acts upon the results. If a reset occurs, the <STRONG>reset</STRONG> method
       for  the  <STRONG>Process</STRONG>  should  be written so that it sets this
       condition flag to an appropriate state.

       <STRONG>RESET_POINT</STRONG> is used  for  specifying  the  reset  position
       within a method where the flow of control will be returned
       to upon detecting a reset.

       <STRONG>MONITOR_RESET(x,y,z)</STRONG> executes statement <STRONG>x</STRONG> and upon comple-
       tion  statements  <STRONG>y</STRONG> and <STRONG>z</STRONG> are compared. If they are equal,
       then the control flow is returned to the <STRONG>RESET_POINT.</STRONG>

       <STRONG>CHECK_RESET(y,z)</STRONG> compares statements <STRONG>y</STRONG> and <STRONG>z</STRONG>  and  returns
       control to the <STRONG>RESET_POINT</STRONG> if they are equal.
