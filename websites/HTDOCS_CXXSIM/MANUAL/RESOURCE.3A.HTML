<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       C++  provides  no garbage collection mechanism, and there-
       fore keeping track of references to  objects  and  knowing
       when  they  can  be  correctly destroyed can be difficult.
       Simply calling <STRONG>delete</STRONG> on a  pointer  to  an  object  could
       leave  dangling references, or, if the object was actually
       created on the stack, result in the failure of the  appli-
       cation.

       The  aim  of  the <STRONG>Resource</STRONG> class is to provide a reference
       counting mechanism for all derived classes, and  to  auto-
       matically remove objects when they are no longer required.
       However, for this to work a new style  of  programming  is
       required.

       When  a reference counted object is created, its reference
       count is zero. Before using the object, it should be  ref-
       erenced using the <EM>static</EM> <STRONG>ref</STRONG> method, passing the object as
       the parameter.

       When finished with the object it  should  be  unreferenced
       using  the  <EM>static</EM>  <STRONG>unref</STRONG>  method.  If the reference count
       reaches zero then the object will be  deleted  if  it  was
       created  on the heap, otherwise nothing will happen to it.
       However, no attempt should be made to use the object after
       <STRONG>unref</STRONG>  has been called as it cannot be guaranteed that the
       object will be valid.

       Both <STRONG>ref</STRONG> and <STRONG>unref</STRONG> are <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> pointer tolerant.

       The operators  <STRONG>new</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>delete</STRONG>  are  provided  to  enable

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       The <STRONG>Thread</STRONG> class derives from  <STRONG>Resource</STRONG>  and  C++SIM  uses
       this  to determine when it can delete threaded objects. If
       this facility is not required, then the system  should  be
       built using the <STRONG>-DNO_RESOURCE</STRONG> flag.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       A  race condition could occur during object creation which
       would mean that an object may  incorrectly  think  it  was
       created  on  the stack. If this happens, a memory leak may
       result. A solution for this is being examined.
