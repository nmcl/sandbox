<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       An instance of this class represents the simulation sched-
       uler.  It maintains the queue of <STRONG>Process</STRONG> objects which are
       currently  inactive,  and determines which process will be
       activated next.

       In versions of C++SIM prior to 1.6  the  scheduler  was  a
       threaded  object.   However,  for performance reasons this
       was changed, and the scheduler is no longer  derived  from
       the  thread  implementation class. To maintain some degree
       of backward compatibility, the methods Suspend and  Resume
       remain  in the scheduler class, but correspond to suspend-
       ing and resuming the simulation, rather  than  the  sched-
       uler. (The overall effect is the same as in older versions
       of C++SIM). The names of these routines may change.

       It is not possible for simulations to create instances  of
       this class. Instead the system guarantees that a scheduler
       exists when needed. This is hidden by  the  <EM>static</EM>  method
       <STRONG>scheduler()</STRONG>  which  returns  a  reference to the scheduler
       object.

       If the simulation requires to remove this scheduler object
       it should invoke the <EM>static</EM> <STRONG>terminate()</STRONG> method.

       The  <STRONG>CurrentTime()</STRONG>  method  returns the current simulation
       time.
       quent  run.  This first resets the simulation time to 0.0,
       and then resets all of the  processes  on  the  simulation
       queue.  All  simulation  processes  have  a  corresponding
       method which the scheduler invokes.
