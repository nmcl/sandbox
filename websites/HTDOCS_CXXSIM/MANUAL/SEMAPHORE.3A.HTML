<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Application  code  can  be  protected from simulation pro-
       cesses through semaphores,  which  are  instances  of  the
       <STRONG>Semaphore</STRONG> class.

       A  semaphore is exclusively acquired, and can exist in one
       of two states:

            <EM>available</EM> : the semaphoe can be acquired.

            <EM>unavailable</EM> : a process has acquired  the  semaphore.
       If  another process attempts to acquire it then it will be
       suspended until the semaphore is <EM>available</EM> again.

       A process attempting to acquire a semaphore should  invoke
       the  <STRONG>Get</STRONG>  method  of  the semaphore, passing itself as the
       parameter. The process will be suspended if the  semaphore
       cannot be acquired.

       A process which successfully acquires the semaphore should
       invoke its <STRONG>Release</STRONG> method when it is no  longer  required.
       This  will automatically enable other processes to attempt
       to acquire the semaphore and enter the protected region.

       <STRONG>NumberWaiting</STRONG> returns  the  number  of  currently  waiting
       (suspended) processes.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       If  the  semaphore  goes out of scope with processes still
       waiting for it then an error message is displayed. No fur-
       ther action is attempted on behalf of these processes.
