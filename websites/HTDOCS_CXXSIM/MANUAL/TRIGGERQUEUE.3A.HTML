<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       An instance of this  class  maintain  a  queue  of  <STRONG>Entity</STRONG>
       objects  waiting  for  application  specific events. These
       objects are placed  on  a  queue  via  the  <STRONG>WaitForTrigger</STRONG>
       method of the <STRONG>Entity</STRONG> class.

       Applications  can  then  use these queues to simulate spe-
       cific events, for example processor interrupt levels. When
       an event occurs, members of a queue can be informed (trig-
       gered) using one of the two methods provided.

       The <STRONG>triggerAll</STRONG> method triggers all of the members  of  the
       queue.  These  objects  will know that they were triggered
       and not interrupted.

       <STRONG>triggerFirst</STRONG> triggers only the member at the head  of  the
       queue.  If the parameter is <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> then the object will not
       know it was triggered, and will assume it was  interrupted
       from its <EM>waiting</EM> state.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       If a queue is not empty when it goes out of scope then all
       remaining members will be triggered and placed back on  to
       the scheduler queue.
