<H2>Description</H2>
C++SIM is an object-oriented simulation package written in C++. It provides
discrete event process-based simulation similar to SIMULA's simulation class
and libraries. A complete list of the facilities provided follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> the core of the system gives SIMULA-like simulation routines,
random number generators, queueing algorithms, and thread package interfaces.
<LI> entity and set manipulation facilities similar to SIMSET.
<LI> classes allow "non-causal" events, such as interrupts, to be handled.
<LI> various statistical gathering routines, such as histogram and variance classes.
<LI> debugging classes.
</UL>
The system also comes with complete examples and test routines which illustrate many
of the issues raised in using the simulation package.

<H2>History</H2>
C++SIM was originally developed by members of the <A HREF="http://arjuna.ncl.ac.uk">Arjuna
project</A> to aid in the building of fault-tolerant distributed systems. The package has
been extensively used for distributed systems simulation, and continues to aid in that
area and simulation in general.

<H2>Environment</H2>
Sun workstations running SunOS 4, Solaris 2, HP9000s300 & HP9000s700 workstations using HPUX,
Windows 95 and Windows NT (3.5.1 and 4.0), and i386 compatible machines using Linux.
The thread packages currently supported include: Sun's lightweight processes (lwp) library, Solaris
threads, various flavours of Posix threads, NT threads, the C++ Task Library, C threads,
and the Gnu Rex lightweight processes library.
