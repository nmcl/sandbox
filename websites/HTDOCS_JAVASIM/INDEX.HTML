<P>
Welcome to the new JavaSim home page, Department of Computing Science,
University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.
<P>
JavaSim is a set of <A HREF="http://javasoft.com">Java</A> packages for
building discrete event process-based simulation, similar to that in
Simula and <A HREF="http://cxxsim/">C++SIM</A> (from which JavaSim is derived).
<P>
<I>This homepage is now resident on a new machine javasim.ncl.ac.uk</I>
<P>
This pages is still under development, so there isn't a lot here at the
moment. We hope to remedy that as soon as possible.
