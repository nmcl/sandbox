      <p>All programs in the ht://Dig system (<a href="htdig.html">htdig</a>,
	<a href="htmerge.html">htmerge</a>,
	<a href="htsearch.html" target="_top">htsearch</a>,
	<a href="htfuzzy.html">hyfuzzy</a>, and
	<a href="htnotify.html">htnotify</a>
	) use a flexible configuration file.
	This configuration file is a plain ASCII text file.
	Each line in the file is either a comment or contains an
	attribute.
	Comment lines are blank lines or lines that start with a '#'.
	Attributes consist of a variable name and an associated value:</p>
      <dl compact="compact"><dt></dt><dd>
	  <tt>&lt;name&gt;:&lt;whitespace&gt;&lt;value&gt;&lt;newline&gt;</tt>
      </dl>
      The &lt;name&gt; contains any alphanumeric character or underline (_)
      The &lt;value&gt; can include any character except newline.  It also
      cannot start with spaces or tabs since those are considered part of
      the whitespace after the colon.  It is important to keep in mind that
      any trailing spaces or tabs will be included.
      <p>
	It is possible to split the &lt;value&gt; across several lines
	of the configuration file by ending each line with a backslash
	(\).  The effect on the value is that a space is added where
	the line split occurs.
      <p>
	Each program only extract the attributes it needs and hence it
	is most convenient to use the same configuration file with all
	ht://Dig programs.  If an attribute is specified more than
	once in the file, only the last one will be used.
      </p>
      <p>
	If a program needs a particular attribute and it is not in the
	configuration file, it will use the default value which is
	defined in <tt>htcommon/defaults.cc</tt>.
