      <p>
	The system performs three major tasks that should be performed
	in the following order:
      </p>
      <h3><a href="#Digging">Digging</a></h3>
      <dl>
	<dd>
	  Before you can search, a database of all the documents that
	  need to be searched has to be created.
      </dl>
      <h3><a href="#Merging">Merging</a></h3>
      <dl>
	<dd>
	  Once the document database has been created, it has to be
	  converted to something that can be searched quickly.  Also,
	  if you want to only update changed documents, these changes
	  have to be merged into the searchable database.<br> Even
	  though this task could be performed at the same time as the
	  Digging, it is a separate process for efficiency reasons.
	  It also gives more flexibility to what actually happens at
	  merge time.
      </dl>
      <h3><a href="#Searching">Searching</a></h3>
      <dl>
	<dd>
	  Finally, the databases that were created in the previous
	  steps can be used to perform actual searches.  Normally,
	  searches will be invoked by a CGI program which gets its
	  input from the user through an HTML form.
      </dl>

      <hr noshade>
      <h3><a name="Digging">Digging</a></h3>
      <p>
	Digging is the first step in creating a search database.  This
	system uses the word <i>digging</i> while other systems call
	it <i>harvesting</i> or <i>gathering</i>.  In the ht://Dig
	system, the program <a href="htdig.html">htdig</a> performs
	the information gathering stage.  In this process, the program
	will act as a regular web user, except that it will follow
	<em>all</em> hyperlinks that it comes across. (Actually, it
	will not follow all of them, just those that are within the
	domain it needs to gather information on...)
	<br>
	Each document it goes to is examined and all the unique words
	in this document are extracted and stored.
      <p>
	The digging process will create at least two files.  The first
	one is the list of all the words and the second one is a
	database of URLs and information about the URLs.
      </p>


      <hr noshade>
      <h3><a name="Merging">Merging</a></h3>
      <p>
	Once the digging process has completed, it needs to be
	converted into something the search engine can actually use.
	The <a href="htmerge.html">htmerge</a> program will use the
	information from previous digs to create a database that the
	search engine can use.  It uses the term 'merge' because it
	will take data from several databases and merges them into
	several other databases.  The source databases include the
	databases created by the Digging process but also an previous
	merged databases.  These old databases are used if the Digging
	process produced information only for documents which have
	changed.</p>
      <p>
	There are several optional tasks which also fit into the merge phase:
      </p>
      <dl>
	<dt>Expiration notification:</dt>
	<dd>
	  The ht://Dig system includes a handy reminder service which
	  allows HTML authors to add some ht://Dig specific meta
	  information in HTML documents.  This meta information is
	  used to email authors after a specified date.  Very useful
	  to maintain lists that contain those annoying 'new' graphics
	  with new items.  (Hint: things really aren't all that 'new'
	  anymore after 6 months!)<br> The <a
	    href="htnotify.html">htnotify</a> program performs this
	  task.
	</dd>
	<dt>Fuzzy word index creation:</dt>
	<dd>
	  To allow the searches to use ``fuzzy'' algorithms to match
	  words, the <a href="htfuzzy.html">htfuzzy</a> program can create
	  indexes for several different algorithms.
	</dd>
      </dl>

      <hr noshade>
      <h3><a name="Searching">Searching</a></h3>
      <p>
	Searching is where the users actually get to use all the
	information that was gathered during the dig and merge stages.
	The <a href="htsearch.html" target="_top">htsearch</a> program
	performs the actual searches.  It produces <tt>HTML</tt>
	output which will be seen by the users.
      </p>
