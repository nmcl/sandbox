      <h2>HTML Form</h2>
      <p>
	The primary interface to htsearch is through an HTML form.
	When the form is submitted, the htsearch program will take
	values from the form and perform the actual search.  The
	search can be modified in many ways with either hidden input
	fields or other HTML form tags.  Study the examples to get a
	feel of what things are possible.
      <p>
	The HTML form is expected to contain at least an input text
	field named <b>words</b>.  This is where the user will enter
	the search words.  Other values are also recognized but have
	appropriate defaults in case they are not used:
      <p>
      <dl>
	<dt><b>config</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  Specifies the name of the configuration file.  The name
	  here is the name without the path and without the
	  <i>.conf</i> at the end.  This file is assumed to be
	  located in the CONFIG_DIR directory.<br>
	  The detault is <i>htdig</i>
	</dd>
	<dt><b>exclude</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This value is a pattern that all URLs of the search
	  results cannot match.<br>
	  The default is blank.
	</dd>
	<dt><b>format</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This specifies the name of the template to display the
	  search results in.  There are two builtin templates named
	  <i>builtin-long</i> and <i>builtin-short</i> which can be
	  used, but any number of custom templates can also be
	  defined.  Find out more about the templates in the <a
	  href="hts_templates.html">Output Templates</a> section.<br>
	  The <i>format</i> value can be specified as either a hidden
	  input field or a drop down menu.<br> The default is
	  specified by the <i>template_name</i> attribute in the
	  configuration file.
	</dd>
	<dt><b>keywords</b></dr>
	<dd>
	  Used to specify a list of required words that have to be in
	  the documents.  This list of words is added to the normal
	  <i>words</i> value using logical "and"s.<br>
	  An example use for this value is to make it a drop down menu with
	  a limited set of predetermined categories or keywords to restrict
	  the search.  This can be very useful for very structured pages.
	</dd>
	<dt><b>matchespserpage</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  Specifies how many matches will be displayed on each page of
	  results.<br> The default is specified by the
	  <i>matches_per_page</i> attribute in the configuration file.
	  Since this value has to be a number, it either needs to be
	  set using a hidden input field or a with a drop down menu.
	</dd>
	<dt><b>method</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This can be one of <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, or <i>boolean</i>.
	  It determines what type of search will be performed.<br> The
	  default is specified by the <i>match_method</i> attribute in
	  the configuration file.  It is quite useful to make this
	  item a drop down menu so the user can select the type of
	  search at search time.
	</dd>
	<dt><b>page</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This should normally not be used.  It is generated by the
	  paged results display.
	</dd>
	<dt><b>restrict</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This value is a pattern that all URLs of the search results
	  will have to match.  This can be used to restrict the search
	  to a particular subtree or subsection of a bigger
	  database.<br> The default is blank.
	</dd>
      </dl>
