      <h2>Search Method Used</h2>
      The way htsearch performs it search and applies its ranking
      rules are fairly complicated.  This is an attempt at explaining
      in global terms what goes on when htsearch searches.
      <p>
	htsearch gets a list of words from the HTML form that invoked
	it.  If htsearch was invoked with boolean expression parsing
	enabled, it will do a quick syntax check on the input words.
	If there are syntax errors, it will display the syntax error
	file that is specified with the
	<a href="attrs.html#syntax_error_file">syntax_error_file</a>
	attribute.
      <p>
	If the boolean parser was not enabled, the list of words is
	converted into a boolean expression by putting either "and"s or
	"or"s between the words.  (This depends on the search type.)
      <p>
	In both cases, each of the words in the list is now expanded
	using the search algorithms that were specified in the 
	<a href="attrs.html#search_algorithm">search_algorithm</a>
	attribute.  For example, the endings algorithm will convert a
	word like "person" into "person or persons".  In this fashion,
	all the specified algorithms are used on each of the words and
	the result is a new boolean expression.
      <p>
	The next step is to perform database lookups on the words in
	the expression.  The result of these lookups are then passed
	to the boolean expression parser.
      <p>
	The boolean expression parser is a simple recursive descent
	parser with an operand stack.  It knows how to deal with
	"and", "or" and parenthesis.  The result of the parser will be
	one set of matches.
      <p>
	At this point, the matches are ranked.  The rank of a match is
	determined by the weight of the words that caused the match
	and the weight of the algorithm that generated the word.
	Word weights are generally determined by the importance of the
	word in a document.  For example, words in the title of a
	document have a much higher weight than words at the bottom of
	the document.
      <p>
	Finally, when the document ranks have been determined and the
	documents sorted, the resulting matches are displayed.  If
	paged output is required, only a subset of all the matches
	will be displayed.
