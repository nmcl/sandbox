      <p>
	This document will attempt to show the steps needed to build and
	install the ht://Dig system.<br>
	The main sections are:
      <ul>
	<li><a href="where.html">Getting the software</a></li>
	<li><a href="#extract">Extracting the software</a></li>
	<li><a href="#configure">Configure</a></li>
	<li><a href="#compile">Compile</a></li>
	<li><a href="#install">Install</a></li>
      </ul>

      <hr noshade>
      <h2><a name="extract">Extracting the software</a></h2>
      The distribution of ht://Dig is in the form of a gzipped tar file.
      The name of the file will be something like
      <tt>htdig-3.0b5.tar.gz</tt>.
      To extract, you can use either the GNU tar command as follows:
      <blockquote>% <b>tar xzf <em>tarfile.tar.gz</em></b></blockquote>
      If you do not have GNU tar, you can do the following:
      <blockquote>% <b>gunzip -c <em>tarfile.tar.gz</em> | tar xf -</b></blockquote>
      In either case, a new directory will be created under which the
      distribution will be extracted.  The directory it creates will be
      <tt>htdig-</tt> followed by the version number.
      <hr noshade>
      <h2><a name="configure">Configure</a></h2>
      <p>
	Once the distribution has been extracted, change to the newly created
	directory.<br> 
	In this directory you will need to edit the file
	<tt>CONFIG</tt>.  There are several values which you need to change in
	this file.
      <dl>
	<dt><tt>DEST</tt></dt>
	<dd>This is where all of the ht://Dig parts will be installed.
	  Various other variables will use this value as their base.
	</dd>
	<dt><tt>BIN_DIR</tt></dt>
	<dd>
	  All the ht://Dig executable programs will go here.
	</dd>
	<dt><tt>CONFIG_DIR</tt></dt>
	<dd>
	  Configuration files will be placed here.
	</dd>
	<dt><tt>COMMON_DIR</tt></dt>
	<dd>
	  This directory is for files which can be shared between
	  different search databases.
	</dd>
	  <dt><tt>DATABASE_DIR</tt></dt>
	<dd>
	  Set this to the directory where the search databases are
	  going to be.  (Make sure there is plenty of space on the
	  partition you put this on!)
	</dd>
	<dt><tt>DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE</tt></dt>
	<dd>
	  Point this to where all the tools will look for the
	  configuration file.  You can define this in terms of
	  <tt>CONFIG_DIR</tt> if you'd like.
	</dd>
	<dt><tt>CGIBIN_DIR</tt></dt>
	<dd>
	  The directory where your HTTP server looks for CGI programs.
	  This is where htsearch will get installed.
	</dd>
	<dt><tt>IMAGE_DIR</tt></dt>
	<dd>
	  Define this to be a place that can be accessed by your web
	  server.  This is where a couple of images will be installed.
	</dd>
	<dt><tt>IMAGE_URL_PREFIX</tt></dt>
	<dd>
	  This is the URL which points to the directory specified by
	  the <tt>IMAGE_DIR</tt> variable above.
	</dd>
	<dt><tt>SEARCH_FORM</tt></dt>
	<dd>
	  The name of the file in which the sample search form will be
	  installed.
	</dd>
      </dl>
      After this, execute the <tt>configure</tt> program:
      <blockquote>% <b>./configure</b></blockquote> This program will
      attempt to determine what your particular system can and can't
      do.
      <p>
	The <b>configure</b> program will produce some warnings about
	libguile and guile.  Ignore those warnings since they do not
	affect the ht://Dig program at all.
      </p>

      <hr noshade>
      <h2><a name="compile">Compile</a></h2>
      <p>
	The configure program will have created Makefiles in all the
	important directories.  It is important to note that the Makefiles
	created assume that you use a <tt>make</tt> program that knows how to
	deal with
      <blockquote>
	  include <em>filename</em>
      </blockquote>
      Some make programs do not allow this or have a different syntax for
      including.  In this case, you should probably obtain
      <a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu">GNU make</a>.
      <p>
	At this point you can optionally add dependency information to all the
	make files with the command
      <blockquote>% <b>make depend</b></blockquote>
      this only needs to be done if you are going to change any of the
      sources to ht://Dig.
      <p>
	Now build the complete system with
      <blockquote>% <b>make</b></blockquote>
      (Sit back and relax for a while...)
      <p>
	If the compilation failed with the error that it cannot find
	libht.a, the most likely problem is that your system does not
	have libg++ installed.  Please check the 
	<a href="require.html">system requirements</a> for details on
	this.
      <hr noshade>
      <h2><a name="install">Install</a></h2>
      <p>
	Everything should have built at this point.  To install the
	software, you need to execute
      <blockquote>% <b>make install</b></blockquote>
      This will perform several tasks.  It will first attempt to create the
      directories that you specified in the CONFIG file.  It will then copy
      the following programs to the <tt>BIN_DIR</tt> directory you specified
      in the CONFIG file:
      <menu>
	<li>htdig</li>
	<li>htmerge</li>
	<li>htfuzzy</li>
	<li>htnotify</li>
      </menu>
      It will also copy the htsearch program to your CGIBIN_DIR directory.
      <p>
	After this, several files will be customized and installed.
	Here is a list of the files that get installed:
      <menu>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><em>CONFIG_DIR</em>/htdig.conf</dt>
	    <dd>A minimal config file which can be used to create a search
	      database for http://htdig.sdsu.edu

	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><em>COMMON_DIR</em>/footer.html</dt>
	    <dd>A sample HTML document that can be used as the search
	      results footer.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><em>COMMON_DIR</em>/header.html</dt>

	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><em>COMMON_DIR</em>/syntax.html</dt>
	    <dd>
	      A sample HTML document that will be displayed if the
	      user entered an illegal boolean expression.  found.
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><em>COMMON_DIR</em>/english.0</dt>
	    <dd>Default list of words with affixes that is used by
	      htfuzzy.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><em>COMMON_DIR</em>/english.aff</dt>
	    <dd>Default affix rule database that is used by htfuzzy.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><em>IMAGE_DIR</em>/star.gif</dt>
	    <dd>The default star image that is used to rank matches.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><em>IMAGE_DIR</em>/star_blank.gif</dt>
	    <dd>The default placeholder image that is the same size as the
	      star, but is blank.  This is used to align the results in the
	      short listing.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><em>IMAGE_DIR</em>/htdig.gif</dt>
	    <dd>The nifty ht://Dig logo.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><em>IMAGE_DIR</em>/button*.gif</dt>

	    <dt><em>BIN_DIR</em>/rundig</dt>
	    <dd>A sample shell script which will create a database.</dd>
	  </dl></li>
      </menu>
      Note that these files will <em>never</em> replace any existing files
      that may already be installed.
      <p>
	It is also important to note that these files are mostly examples.
	As they stand, they will work, but you probably want to modify them to
	reflect your needs.
      <p>
	After the installation, your will be ready to test out everything.
	You can use the <tt>rundig</tt> script to make a test database of the
	online documentation at http://htdig.sdsu.edu.  
      <p>
	The only thing left to do is to modify the <tt>htdig.conf</tt>
	config file which was placed in	<em>CONFIG_DIR</em>/htdig.conf.
	The <a href="attrs.html">Configuration</a> manual has the
	details on how what attributes are needed.
