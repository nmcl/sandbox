      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
	The ht://Dig system is a complete world wide web indexing and
	searching system for a small domain or intranet. This system
	is <strong>not</strong> meant to replace the need for powerful
	internet-wide search systems like Lycos, Infoseek, Webcrawler
	and AltaVista.  Instead it is meant to cover the search needs
	for a single company, campus, or even a particular sub section
	of a web site.
	<br>
	As opposed to some WAIS-based or web-server based search
	engines, ht://Dig can span several web servers at a site.  The
	type of these different web servers doesn't matter as long as
	they understand the HTTP 1.0 protocol.
      <p>
	ht://Dig was developed at <a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/">San
	Diego State University</a> as a way to search the various web
	servers on the campus network.  Here are some examples of the
	application of ht://Dig on the SDSU network:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/">A "Quick" search on the main
	    campus home page</a>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/search/">A more comprehensive
	    interface to the same</a>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="http://libweb.sdsu.edu/catalog/Search.html">A search of
	    the online SDSU General Catalog</a>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/doc/">Searches through various
	    online documentation</a>
	</li>
      </ul>
      <form action="http://htdig.sdsu.edu/cgi-bin/htsearch" method="post">
	<p>You can search this documentation as well:<br>
	  <input type="HIDDEN" name="method" value="and">
	  <input type="TEXT" name="words" size="40">
	  <input type="SUBMIT" value="Search">
      </form>
      <p>
	Many different types of searches can be set up using only a
	single search database.  For example, the the online
	documentation search above uses the same database as the
	campus main search.  The difference between the searches is
	that the documentation search will only show results related
	to the online documentation.

		ht://Dig.
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><strong>Boolean expression searching</strong></dt>
	    <dd>
	      Searches can be arbitrarily complex using boolean
	      expressions.
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><strong>Configurable search results</strong></dt>
	    <dd>
	      The output of a search can easily be tailored to your
	      needs by means of providing HTML templates.
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><strong>Fuzzy searching</strong></dt>
	    <dd>
	      Searches can be performed using various configurable
	      algorithms.  Currently the following algorithms are
	      supported (in any combination):
	      <ul>
		<li>exact</li>
		<li>soundex</li>
		<li>metaphone</li>
		<li>common word endings</li>
		<li>synonyms</li>
	      </ul>
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><strong>Searching of HTML and text files</strong></dt>
	    <dd>
	      Both HTML documents and plain text files can be

	      supported in future versions.
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><strong>Keywords can be added to HTML documents</strong></dt>
	    <dd>
	      Any number of keywords can be added to HTML documents
	      which will not show up when the document is viewed.
	      This is used to make a document more like to be found
	      and also to make it appear higher in the list of
	      matches.
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><strong>Email notification of expired documents</strong></dt>
	    <dd>
	      Special meta information can be added to HTML documents
	      which can be used to notify the maintainer of those
	      documents at a certain time.  It is handy to get
	      reminded when to remove the "New" images from a certain
	      page, for example.
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><strong>A Protected server can be indexed</strong></dt>
	    <dd>
	      ht://Dig can be told to use a specific username and
	      password when it retrieves documents.  This can be used
	      to index a server or parts of a server that are
	      protected by a username and password.
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><strong>Searches on subsections of the database</strong></dt>
	    <dd>
	      It is easy to set up a search which only returns documents
	      whose URL matches a certain pattern.  This becomes very
	      useful for people who want to make their own data
	      searchable without having to use a separate search engine
	      or database.
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><strong>Full source code included</strong></dt>
	    <dd>
	      The search engine comes with full source code.  The whole
	      system is released under the terms and conditions of the

	<li>
	  <dl>
	    <dt><strong>The depth of the search can be limited</strong></dt>
	    <dd>
	      Instead of limiting the search to a set of machines, it
	      can also be restricted to documents that are a certain
	      number of "mouse-clicks" away from the start document.
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <dl>

      </ul>
