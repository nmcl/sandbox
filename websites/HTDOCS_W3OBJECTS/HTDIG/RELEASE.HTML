      <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.8b1</strong> 27-Apr-1997<br>
      I consider this a beta release since I have not had time to test
      everything.  Use at your own risk...
      <ul>
	<li>Base tag problem fixed
	<li>URL parser somewhat more robust
	<li>Date parsing bug fixed
	<li>Added Substring fuzzy algorithm.
	<li>Various other bugs were fixed.  Thanks for all the patches
	    that were sent to me!
      </ul>
      <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.7</strong> 12-Jan-1997<br>
      More bug fixes and some minor new functionality.  Hopefully,
      I'll be able to finish up work on version 3.1 at some point in
      the near future.<br>
      I have recently received some more patches for various things,
      but I have not incorporated those, yet.  Next version.
      <ul>
	<li>The problem with the missing words has been fixed.  This
	  was a problem in the Dictionary class.</li>
	<li>htsearch is a *lot* faster due to a patch by Esa
	  Ahola.</li>
	<li>htfuzzy has some work done to it.  With the addition of
	  the new rx-1.4 library, the endings algorithm now actually
	  works for languages other than Enlish...  It still takes an
	  awfull long time to build the tables for languages with lots
	  of rules.</li>
	<li>URLs now can be of the dubious form http:foo.html  I have
	  never seen this used and think it is bogus, but alas, it
	  works now.</li>
	<li>A search form can now manually add words to any search
	  using the new <i>keywords</i> form attribute.</li>
	<li>A problem in the plaintext parser used to cause bogus HTML
	  in search results.  This has been fixed.</li>
	<li>New documentation format.  Lots of new documentation, as
	  well.</li>
	<li>New tobotstxt_name attribute.  Used to match the
	  'user-agent' lines in robots.txt files.</li>
	<li>The &lt;base&gt; tag is now properly supported.
	<li>Preliminary support for lots of new features, including:
	  <ul>
	    <li>External document parsers.  You'll be able to write
	      your own document parser for that special document type
	      that ht://Dig doesn't know about.</li>
	    <li>New fuzzy search algorithms: substring, regex,
	      globbing, etc.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.6</strong> 26-Oct-1996<br>
      Just a single bug fix and one additional feature in this release.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Fixed the problem that caused frequent crashes with virtual memory
	  exhausted.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Added a new attribute, keywords_meta_tag_names, which should
	  contain a list of meta tag names for which the content
	  should be used as keywords.  The default is set to "keywords
	  htdig-keywords"
	</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.5</strong> 13-Oct-1996<br>
      This release consists of more bug fixes.<br>
      I want to thank Elliot Lee &lt;sopwith@cuc.edu&gt; for his help with
      tracking down several bugs.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Fixed problem with accent characters.  Words with SGML
	  entities and iso-8859-1 characters will now be indexed
	  correctly.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Changed the auto configuration to detect the need for a prototype
	  for the gethostname() function.  (This was supposed to be fixed
	  before, but wasn't)
	</li>
	<li>
	  Reduced the memory requirements for all the programs by changing
	  the rehash() method in the Dictionary class.  Access to hashes
	  may be a little slower, but the memory requirements were reduced by
	  a factor 10 or so.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Hopefully fixed a problem with the time related functions on
	  certain platforms.  More checks are done to make sure the
	  functions that are used are actually available.
	</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.4</strong> 2-Sep-1996<br>
      The previous version failed to build under Linux.  This should be
      fixed now.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Fixed problem with the time stuff which caused the build of
	  htdig to fail.
	</li>
	<li>Fixed a memory problem in htdig
	</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.3</strong> 2-Sep-1996<br>
      Bugs bugs bugs...  Will they <i>ever</i> all be found?
      <p>
	<b>NOTE</b>: I made extensive changes to the htdig.conf file that
	gets installed.  I would advise you to remove or rename your
	existing htdig.conf and let the installation process create a
	new one for you that you can then modify.
      <p>
	Also, since the rundig script has changed, you should remove
	the old one before installing ht://Dig.  (The installation
	will refuse to overwrite existing files...)
      <ul>
	<li>
	  The problem with htsearch crashing on some machines has been
	  fixed.
	</li>
	<li>
	  A bug caused the &lt;AREA&gt; tab to be ignored.  Fixed.
	</li>
	<li>
	  A bug in SunOS caused dates to be all screwed up.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Added lots of comments to the example htdig.conf file.  Also
	  added some additional example attributes.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Fixed a bug in the installation process which caused rundig
	  to be created incorrectly.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Added a sample synonyms file.  Also modified rundig to
	  create a synonyms database for it.
	</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.2</strong> 22-Aug-1996<br>
      More bug fixes.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Multiple start URLs now actually work.  Before they were
	  just documented to work, but didn't actually work. 
	</li>
	<li>
	  htmerge now will refuse to remove database files if it
	  detects that the call to /bin/sort failed.
	</li>
	<li>
	  htmerge can now tell /bin/sort to use a specific temporary
	  directory.  This is done by setting the TMPDIR environment
	  variable.
	</li>
	<li>
	  htsearch can now search for words with non-ASCII characters
	  in them.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Added support for finding URLs in the &lt;frame&gt; and
	  &lt;area&gt; tags.
	</li>
	<li>
	  There is a problem with htsearch under Linux.  It causes a
	  segmentation violation after the first search result is
	  displayed.  Don't know what the problem is, yet.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Fixed bug in the auto configuration which always set the
	  value for NEED_PROTO_GETHOSTNAME to 1.  For most systems
	  this actually needs to be 0.
	</li>
      <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.1</strong> 16-Aug-1996<br>
      This is a maintenance release in response to several bug reports.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  htdig now will display a list of errors when the statistics
	  option (-s) is used.  The list gives the URL that caused the
	  error and a URL that referred to it.  Hopefully this
	  information is useful for site maintainers.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Some problems with the SGML character entities were fixed.
	  The major symptom was that the ';' that ends an entity used
	  to be included as well.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Major problems with htnotify were fixed.  There were many
	  hardcoded things in this program that made it very specific
	  to SDSU and to me.
	</li>
	<li>
	  malloc.h should not be included anymore.  All references to
	  it were replaced with stdlib.h instead.  This should make
	  compiles on some platforms work better.
	</li>
	<li>
	  htsearch now will use the CONFIG_DIR environment variable to
	  override the compiled in default.  (set in the CONFIG
	  file...)  This was done so that htsearch can be called from
	  a simple wrapper that sets that environment variable.  Only
	  the wrapper needs to be be modified to get different
	  CONFIG_DIR values.
	</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0</strong> 17-Jul-1996<br>
      I decided to make this the <i>official</i> 3.0 release.
      <blockquote><blockquote><font face="Helvetica" size="+1">
	It is <strong>extreemely</strong> important that you remove
	all traces of earlier beta versions of the software before
	installing this version or that you install in a completely
        different location.  Do not blame me for anything if you
	didn't do this.  You have been warned...
      </font></blockquote></blockquote>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  htwrapper is no more.  htsearch is now the CGI program
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="htsearch.html" target="_top">htsearch</a> now uses
	  templates to display the results.  A template is simply a
	  piece of HTML code for a single match.  The HTML code
	  includes variables that will be expanded to the various
	  items that are unique to each match, like URL, EXCERPT,
	  TITLE, etc.  The template can be selected at search time
	  (through a menu).  There are two builtin templates:
	  <tt>builtin-short</tt> and <tt>builtin-long</tt>.  The
	  <tt>builtin-short</tt> template just lists the stars and
	  title while the <tt>builtin-long</tt> template lists results
	  in a similar fashion to the way Alta Vista displays results.
	</li>
	<li>Many runtime configuration options have been removed and
	  many new ones have been added.  Check the <a
	    href="attrs.html">configuration file</a> documentation
	  for details.  There are also some enhancements to the format
	  of the configuration file.
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Attribute values can now span multiple lines by ending
	      each line that needs to be continued with a backslash
	      ('\').
	      The file that is specified is read in and all
	      newlines and starting and trailing whitespaces are
	      reduced to a single space.  If the file is not
	      found, nothing is included and no error is flagged.
	      <br>
	      Note that the backquote character is used, not the
	      regular quote character.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Attribute values can now include the contents of files.
	      Just put the filename in back-quotes.  The filename can
	      use the normal variable expansion so that things like:
	      <blockquote>
		  <tt>someattribute: `${common_dir}/somefile`</tt>
	      </blockquote>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  Notable attribute changes:
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      All the attributes that set the heading text have been
	      removed.  These attributes include:
	      <ul>
		<li>accessed_heading_text</li>
		<li>datesize_heading_text</li>
		<li>descriptions_heading_text</li>
		<li>excerpt_heading_text</li>
		<li>modified_heading_text</li>
		<li>score_heading_text</li>
		<li>size_heading_text</li>
		<li>url_heading_text</li>
		<li>wordlist_heading_text</li>
		<li>field_order</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      New attributes added:
	      <dl>

		</dd>
		<dt><b>text_factor</b></dt>
		<dd>
		  Added to allow normal text to have a variable weight
		  (0, for example...)
		</dd>
	      </dl>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Some form tag names have changed.  The list of recognized
	  form tags are in the <a href="htsearch.html"
	  target="_top">htsearch</a> documentation.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Multiple start urls can be specified as a value to the
	  'start_url' attribute.  This could be combined with the
	  file inclusion to read in a file of URLs to start with.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="htdig.html">htdig</a> now sends the 'Referer:'
	  header in HTTP requests so that any link errors will be
	  logged in the server's log files.
	</li>
	<li>
	  In addition to the "htdig-keywords" META tag name, <a
	    href="htdig.html">htdig</a> now also supports just
	  "keywords".  This is to make it more compatible with the
	  Alta Vista search engine.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The verbose display of <a href="htdig.html">htdig</a> was
	  enhanced to show '+' for a link that will be followed and
	  '-' for a link that was discarded.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="htmerge.html">htmerge</a> was changed to use the
	  Unix sort program instead of doing its own sorting.  It no
	  longer uses mmap() to map the words into memory.  This was
	  causing problems on systems with limited virtual memory
	  available.  (What???  You mean you DON'T have at least a 1GB
	  disk dedicated to swap???)
	</li>
	<li>
	  The Endings algorithm was fixed up to work properly now.
	  There were several well hidden bugs that made the algorithm
	  come up with illegal words.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The <strong>synonyms</strong> fuzzy algorithm was added.
	  This is simply a mapping of words to other words.  The input
	  file is just a list of words which causes the first word on
	  a line to be mapped to the rest of the words on that line.
	  (We use this to map course abbriviations to full course
	  names)
	</li>
	<li>
	  SGML entities are now supported.  They are translated to
	  their equivalent ISO-8859-1 encoding.
	</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0b5</strong>
      <ul>
	<li>The configuration has changed.  There is now a CONFIG file
	  which contains all the variables which control where
	  things get installed.  'make install' will now actually
	  attempt to set everything up with default or example files.<br>
	  Note that some default directories have changed.  For
	  example, the default configuration file location is not
	  /usr/local/etc/htdig.conf anymore.  Instead it is now
	  defined in terms of CONFIG_DIR.
	</li>
	<li>The htfuzzy/createDict.pl Perl program has been obsoleted.
	  Creating the endings database is now done by htfuzzy
	  itself.  If you already have endings databases, you don't
	  need to recreate them, they will still work.
	</li>
	<li>GNU rx-1.0 is now included with the distribution.  This is
	  used by htfuzzy to create the endings databases.
	</li>
	<li>The name of the whole search system has changed from
	  <em>HTDig</em> to <em>ht://Dig</em>.
	</li>
	<li>The HTML documentation got a big facelift!  This includes
	  the new logo for ht://Dig.  (Thanks goes to Keith Parks
	  for the Images!)
	</li>
	<li>htsearch got a new option '-r' which will allow it to
	  produce raw output.  This output can easily parsed by a
	  wrapper program to produce custom HTML or other output for
	  the search results.
	</li>
      </ul>
