      <h1>Requirements to build ht://Dig</h1>
      <p>
	ht://Dig was developed under Unix using C++.
      <p>
	For this reason, you will need a Unix machine, a C compiler
	and a C++ compiler. (The C compiler is needed to compile some
	of the GNU libraries)
      <p>
	Unfortunately, I only have access to a couple of different
	Unix machines.  ht://Dig has been tested on these machines:
      <ul>
	<li>Sun Solaris 2.5 SPARC (using gcc/g++ 2.7.2)</li>
	<li>Sun SunOS 4.1.4 SPARC (using gcc/gcc 2.7.0)</li>
	<li>HP/UX A.09.01 (using gcc/g++ 2.6.0)</li>
	<li>IRIX 5.3 (SGI C++ compiler.  Don't know the version)</li>
      </ul>
      Other people have compiled it under Linux as well.
      <h3>libg++</h3>
	If you plan on using g++ to compile ht://Dig, you have to make
	sure that libg++ has been installed.  Unfortunately, libg++ is
	a separate package from gcc/g++.  You can get libg++ from the
	<a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">GNU software
	  archive</a>.
      <h3>Berkeley 'make'</h3>
	The building relies heavily on the make program.  The problem
	with this is that not all make programs are the same.  The
	requirement for the make program is that it understands the
	'include' statement as in <blockquote><tt>include
	somefile</tt></blockquote> The Berkeley 4.4 make program
	doesn't use this syntax, instead it wants
	<blockquote><tt>.include "somefile"</tt></blockquote> and
	hence it cannot be used to build ht://Dig.
      <p>
	If your make program doesn't understand the right 'include'
	syntax, it is best if you get and install <a
	href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">gnumake</a> before you
	try to compile everything.  The alternative is to change all
	the Makefiles.

      <h1>Disk space requirements</h1>
      <p>
	The search engine will require lots of disk space to store its
	databases. Unfortunately, there is no exact formula to compute
	the space requirements.  It depends on the number of documents
	you are going to index but also on the various options you
	use.  To give you an idea of the space requirements, here is
	what I have deduced from our own database size at San Diego
	State University.
      <p>
	If you keep around the wordlist database (for update digging
	instead of initial digging) I found that multiplying the
	number of documents covered by 12,000 will come pretty close
	to the space required.
      <p>
	We have about 13,000 documents:<pre>
         13,000
         12,000 x
    -----------
    156,000,000
</pre>
      or about 150 MB.
      <p>
	Without the wordlist database, the factor drops down to about
	7500:<pre>
         13,000
          7,500 x
     ----------
     97,500,000
</pre>
or about 93 MB.
      <p>
	Keep in mind that we keep at most 50,000 bytes of each
	document.  This may seen a lot, but most documents aren't very
	big and it gives us a big enough chunk to almost always show
	an excerpt of the matches.
      </p>
