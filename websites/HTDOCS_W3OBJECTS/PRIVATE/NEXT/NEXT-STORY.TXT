All,

Here is the history of the WebObjects trademark problem:

We have been using the name WebObjects since late 1994. Since that time I
have given 2 public presentations of the work, and submitted 1 paper, the 
details follow:

Date:		3rd Feb 1995
Workshop:	Broadcast workshop, Lisbon, Portugal
Title:		WebObjects: Ideas for an Object-oriented Web (presentation)

Date:		25th May 1995
Workshop:	ANSA, Cambridge, UK
Title:		WebObjects: Towards an Object-oriented Web

Date:		17th July 1995
submission:	4th International WWW Conference
Title:		WebObjects: Bringing Object-Oriented Technology To The Web

The final item, the paper submitted to the web conference, is what has
started the trouble. The paper was accepted and appeared in the
on-line programme for the conference, to be held in Boston in
December.  NeXT Computers Inc. saw the reference in the programme and
had their attorney send a fax to the conference organisers to request
that the name WebObjects was removed, to which they complied.  I
received an urgent email message from the publishers saying that it
had to be changed.

The letter from NeXT stated that they had begun using the term "long
ago" and had made significant investment in the mark and had filed a
trademark application to protect it. In reality the first public
statement from NeXT announcing WebObjects was a press release on the
14th August 1995.

Because we were afraid that they would pull our paper from the
conference, we decided to change the name from WebObjects to
W3Objects. We asked the publishers to add the following text within
the paper:

"Since 1994, W3Objects was known as WebObjects. We have been forced to
change this owing to a recent trademark application by NeXT Computer
Inc."

The publishers have made the WebObjects->W3Objects change in both the
hypertext and paper version of the proceedings and will definitely
add the above text to the hypertext and probably to the paper version.
The problem here is that they were in the very late stages of 
typesetting when this problem arose.

We have made no direct contact with NeXt ourselves.
