<H1>Arjuna Component of JISC Proposal</H1>

<P>
Large-scale electronic publishing has grown massively since the
advent of the world-wide web. Many factors have contributed to
its success, in particular, the simplicity of the system has played
a significant role in its wide-spread acceptance. Accessing web
information via the hypertext interface is relatively easy to
learn and use. Becoming a publisher on the web is also relatively
straight-forward; users from all professions have been able to
participate, resulting in the huge diversity of the information
currently available. These factors, coupled with free web software
and cross-platform support, have helped establish it as the standard
mechanism for information dissemination for industry and academia.
<P>
However, current Web technology is based on read-only, document-like
resources, with a stateless, connectionless communication protocol.
Although it is possible to construct complex applications using
the basic mechanisms provided and their extensions (e.g., cgi
scripts), this does not form an adequate infrastructure for future
expansion. It can also be extremely difficult for applications
programmers to build these complex applications. Common services,
such as persistence and concurrency control mechanisms are often
implemented in an ad hoc manner, making reuse difficult. What
is required is the necessary infrastructural support to enable
the construction of these complex applications in a scaleable
and extensible manner. We believe that the principles of object-orientation
provide a means to build such an infrastructure.
<P>
Currently, Web resources possess two distinct access interfaces,
namely, via the file system and the HTTP daemon. These access
methods are uncoordinated and not suitable for the types of resources
envisaged in the future. For example, a web-based banking application
providing remote-access to customer accounts, should ideally support
multiple interfaces to the account information; the view a bank
manager sees may be different from that of the customer. The industry
standard object-oriented solution to this type of application
is the OMG ORB architecture (CORBA), which defines a set of standard
services for implementing distributed applications in a heterogeneous
environment. Through the object-oriented principle of data abstraction,
users interact with objects through well defined interfaces, without
being aware of the actual implementation. Those organisations
which possess legacy systems which they require to be used in
their Web environment, e.g., SQL databases, can do so through
suitable object interfaces. Through the use of object-orientation
it will be possible to provide suitable abstract interfaces to
enable the implementations of services and mechanisms (e.g., persistence
through an object-oriented database) to be changed based upon
user requirements.
<P>
Another important issue in distributed systems is that they are
inherently more prone to failures than their centralised counterparts.
The current Web fails to address this issue. The lack of fault-tolerance
and also limited security mechanisms are two of the main reasons
which have delayed the take-up of Web technology for the construction
of complex applications (e.g., management information systems).
<P>
Techniques such as atomic actions (transactions) and replication
can be used to improve fault-tolerance of distributed applications.
Atomic actions possess the well known ACID properties (atomicity,
concurrency, isolation and durability), and are used to guarantee
consistency. Replication can be used to improve object availability
and provide forward progress in the presence of failures. The
Distributed Systems Group of the Department of Computing Science
has over 10 years experience in these areas. One of the outcomes
of this research has been the Arjuna system, which provides tools
to assist in the construction of fault-tolerant distributed applications
using objects and actions. Arjuna is built around the concepts
of object-orientation, whereby objects inherit desirable properties,
such as persistence and concurrency control. Arjuna objects can
also be replicated. Arjuna has been available to academic establishments
for a number of years, and is now being taken up by industry.
<P>
We aim to use the principles and techniques developed in the Arjuna
project to construct the suitable infrastructural support previously
highlighted as being essential for the evolution of the Web. In
order to ensure future compatibility with industrial solutions,
we intend to use CORBA technology as the basis for this work.
This will necessarily involve making the current Arjuna transactional
components compliant with the OMG OTS specification. It is also
possible to build upon existing Arjuna technology to provide other
OMG specified services, such as Concurrency Control, Persistence,
and Externalisation.
<P>
Once complete this infrastructure will allow applications to be
built which comprise arbitrary read/write manipulation of Web
objects, which may be replicated, under transactional control.
Using this infrastructure we shall construct a reliable, distributed
Web server capable of supporting industrial strength applications,
for example the demonstrator applications specified elsewhere
in this proposal.
