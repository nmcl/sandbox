<H2>The Proposed Project</H2>

<P>
Until recently accessing the wide variety of resources (textual
documents, pictures, services, etc.) available on the internet
required specific knowledge of the resource type and the use of
a matching protocol (or set of protocols) e.g., telnet, ftp, etc.,
and a matching viewer in order to display or interact with the
resource. As a result the internet was largely the domain of 'experts'
i.e., those familiar with the required protocols and viewers,
or of 'specialists' i.e., those concerned with particular resource
types, accessed through the use of type specific tools. This situation
has changed with the widespread use of client programs such as
those produced by Mosaic and Netscape, enabling the creation of
the world-wide mesh of inter-related resources, of many types,
which we call the Web. These products owe their success to the
provision of a common, easily understood interface to all resources
through the use of i) <I>hyper-text</I> as a means of structuring
and accessing information in a form readily understood to all
those familiar with documentation schemes, and ii) a single, simple
interface i.e., <I>HTTP</I>, which all client browsers are capable
of supporting.
<P>
However, although the Web as it currently stands, has proved very
successful as a means of publishing and accessing document-based
information, it suffers from a number of limitations which, if
not addressed, will limit its usefulness as a environment which
supports commercial ventures. The current function of the Web
is, primarily, to provide a mechanism by which stable documents
can be browsed freely, within the public domain, and inter-relationships
created between those documents. In order to encourage information
providers to publish on the Web emphasis has been placed upon
low-cost (in terms of computing resource required i.e., a simple,
stateless communication protocol and a minimum of infrastructure)
and in freedom from responsibility i.e., few obligations are placed
upon the publisher in terms of maintaining the availability or
correctness of the information. The policy has been to &quot;Let
the user beware&quot;; whilst this has suited academic institutions
and publishers of other free information, it is clearly inappropriate
for commercial activity (beyond the limited field of advertising).
<P>
Service providers want to offer services which are frequently
more than passive documentation. For example they will want to
be able to provide multi-media services, such as video-on-demand
and electronic newspapers, interactive services such as at-home-learning
and banking systems. Above all service providers want to be able
to charge users for their services. This requires a means of exchanging
payment but more importantly needs mechanisms for security and
authentication to prevent free access and therefore provide a
rationale for charging. In return for payment, service providers
accept obligations such as prescribed availability, performance
and correctness of the service. All of this requires that the
Web be capable of extension in the interfaces via which users
(and administrators) interact with services.
<P>
HTTP may be extended either by applying to the Web's governing
body (the IANA) with detailed proposals, or by the use of <I>CGI
scripts</I> which enable the setting up of arbitrarily complex
protocols between client and server, through a process of negotiation
using HTTP. However, the former is a long process requiring wide-spread
consensus, whilst the later relies on the underlying HTTP in order
to initiate the new protocol, and on a rather unwieldy programming
model which makes it difficult to share interfaces or implementations
between resources.
<P>
In the field of distributed systems design, within which we at
Newcastle University have considerable experience, the object-oriented
approach is widely accepted as an appropriate model for communication
between distributed resources, and as a programming methodology
which encourages the reuse of interfaces and implementations.
For this reason we have been investigating the use of the object-oriented
paradigm within the Web, and have developed an object-oriented
system [Ref. 1], which allows Web resources to be implemented
as objects; <I>W3Objects</I> in our terminology. Our approach
is evolutionary, in that our system runs in parallel to the existing
Web browsers and servers without any detrimental effects, but
users who wish to introduce new resources may design them as W3objects,
or may transform existing resources into W3Objects. W3Objects
support multiple interfaces so whilst they may be accessed through
traditional Web browsers, they can also provide a rich new set
of functionality.
<P>
Our approach is to provide simple guarantees for all W3Objects
in order to maintain the overall integrity of the system, and
flexible mechanisms which allow users to obtain additional guarantees
concerning their personal relationship with chosen W3Objects.
Users of W3Objects are guaranteed that, for as long as they hold
a reference to it, the W3Object continues to be accessible, despite
migrations (a common occurrence for Web resources) and communication
or node failures (a common occurrence on the internet). Maintaining
this guarantee provides a solution to the frustrating problem
of 'broken links' which any Web user will be familiar with, and
allows the automatic garbage collection of W3Objects which are
no longer referenced. Our mechanisms provide a user-centered view
of the Web, making it easy for users to create individualized
name spaces for the W3Objects in which they have an interest,
for groups of users to share such spaces, and for users to specify
appropriate levels of availability, performance and fault-tolerance
for each W3Object, independent of the requirements of others.
<P>
We believe that our model and mechanisms enable service providers
to design flexible, extensible, interactive services. The use
of the object-oriented paradigm encourages component re-use and
will ease interworking with other object-based systems, such as
those providing CORBA implementations.
<P>
As an example consider a service such as an electronic newspaper,
which would allow users to access pages of information linked
in a complex mesh, describing the current news. The paper could
provide links to external information sources, which interested
readers could follow to obtain more detailed knowledge, and to
earlier articles for background and historical perspective. Such
a paper could be updated dynamically as news breaks, provide multi-media
presentations, and offer readers views to match their particular
interests, i.e., personalized newspapers. Implementing this service
poses many challenges. Secure protocols are required for charging
purposes, multiple pages need to be updated atomically so that
users do not obtain inconsistent information, certain pages may
require high availability e.g., the financial news, mechanisms
are required for archiving old news and for monitoring access
to the most popular pages, journalists require write access to
pages (potentially from their personal mobile computers), readers
may require write access to letter pages, etc. The demands on
the service will vary from page to page, minute to minute, demanding
an extremely dynamic response from the provider. We believe that
the high performance and flexibility required by such a service
are beyond the scope of the current static, documentation-based
Web infrastructure but that these demands can be met by the object-oriented
system which we provide.
<P>
We are currently engaged in formulating a research proposal to
explore the use of W3Objects and their interaction with CORBA
services. To this end we are seeking a partner who has experience
as an information provider and is interested in researching and
developing a service such as that described above. We are open
to suggestions as to alternative services with similar requirements
for flexibility and dynamism.
