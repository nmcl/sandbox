<H2>1. Introduction </H2>

<P>
The growth in the use of tools and services for searching and
accessing information available over the Internet has been phenomenal.
<I>Information discovery and repository services</I>  organise
and/or search information distributed across many repositories.
For example, servers for the <I>World Wide Web</I> (WWW) [1] organise
the information as distributed hypertext. WWW clients are provided
with hypertext browsing tools, such as <I>Mosaic</I>, for searching
and fetching information. The list of WWW servers is growing by
leaps and bounds.  
<P>
As researchers in the area of distributed computing, we find the
above trend in the use of the Internet very exciting: there is
now a real scope for field testing and putting to use many of
the ideas we have developed and are in the process of developing.
The services and facilities offered by currently available discovery
and repository services are quite primitive; even simple enhancements,
such as caching facilities, if implemented properly, can yield
substantial performance improvements. More sophisticated enhancements,
such as the provision of attribute based information searching,
inter-server protocols for consistency management of replicated
information etc. can significantly boost a user's ability to explore
the vast amounts of multimedia information available. In short,
experimenting with information discovery and repository services
offers an excellent way of learning and gaining an appreciation
of how the &quot;information highway&quot; will be used. We believe
that the programme of experimental research that we are proposing
here will add to our knowledge of building and managing truly
large scale distributed applications (the areas identified by
the CDS Committee under the heading &quot;Networking Applications&quot;).
 
<P>
We are fortunate in having obtained research funding from SERC,
MOD and ESPRIT for basic research in large scale distributed systems
(SERC grant no. GR/H81078 and ESPRIT basic research project BROADCAST,
project no. 6360). I direct the BROADCAST project which involves
some of Europe's best known academic research groups. Our research
work is addressing the areas of both theory (e.g., scalable algorithms
for group management and multicasting, replica management, locating
objects) and practice (systems architectures and application building
tools). The ROPA  award will enable us to  enhance the scope of
our work  quite significantly.
<P>
The main outcome of our research work has been the development
of tools and techniques for constructing distributed fault-tolerant
systems that make use of standard, commodity hardware and software
components. Two research systems have been designed and implemented.
The first system, <I>Arjuna</I>, demonstrates the application
of modern object-oriented software technology in building general
purpose fault-tolerant distributed applications in workstation
environments [2], whereas the second system, <I>Voltan</I>, demonstrates
the application of novel redundancy management techniques in building
specialist high availability computer systems using ordinary processors
[3].  
<H2>2. Planned Research Work</H2>

<P>
Our main objective is to develop the infrastructure necessary
for the construction of available and responsive multimedia information
repositories that provide information storage, retrieval, searching,
discovery and indexing services by co-operating with other servers
scattered over the Internet. (We intend to side-step the issues
of media synchronisation - there are plenty of other research
groups active in this area; we will exploit their results in our
work.) To get wider user acceptance, we intend to build these
services as much as possible out of existing facilities (e.g.,
WWW). Much of the Arjuna software developed by us for distributed
object management [2], distributed programming [4], storage, replication
and clustering [5, 6]  and transactions will be of direct use
in our work. As remarked earlier, the services and facilities
offered by currently available discovery and repository services
are quite primitive, and open to several improvements indicated
below. The main body of our research is divided into three tasks.
   
<P>
<I>(i) Systems architecture</I>: Believing that the vast numbers
of users will continue to use commodity hardware and software
systems (e.g., PCs running OS/2 or Windows NT) for information
retrieval, we intend to examine ways of constructing a local repository
(object storage service) out of a collection of workstations and
PCs connected by high-speed ATM switch network. Arjuna already
provides a means of treating a collection of distributed object
stores as logically single, dependable store. Further, we are
close to completing a distributed database system on top of Arjuna
that provides indexing and attribute based searching facilities
[7]. Thus, barring equipment, we have the necessary expertise
for constructing such a storage system.         
<P>
<I>(ii) Replication and caching of information</I>: We envisage
two levels of replication: (i) information will be replicated
within a cluster of object stores at a site mainly for increasing
availability; and (ii) there will be extensive caching and replication
of information between sites for performance as well as availability
reasons. At present, WWW clients (and for that matter, clients
of other servers such as Archie) make little effort to cache frequently
used information; further, protocols between servers for exchanging
information for replication purposes are either non-existent or
<I>ad hoc</I>. What is required is a carefully controlled lazy
replication scheme that ensures eventual propagation of updates.
This is an area that requires considerable work. Careful design
and implementation can yield rich rewards in terms of responsiveness
and availability of information.
<P>
<I>(iii) System Monitoring and Managing changes</I>: Related to
the previous task, we envisage the provision of notification services
that enable servers to discard or update out-of-date information
(such as rebinding hyperlinks if some object has moved, obtaining
a fresh copy of  a replica). Further, the use of atomic transactions
will be necessary to make changes to important configuration information.
Monitoring services would be necessary to affect migration of
services as system characteristics, network topology etc. change.
<P>
The work that we will perform above is of generic interest. We
expect the techniques that we will develop to have applicability
in various educational, industrial and commercial settings; an
example would be a commercial information publishing system. There
are several other, quite important aspects of the work that we
are not addressing here (such as charging policies and mechanisms,
security); we expect other groups to take up these issues.   

<H2> 3. Current Industry Supported Research Work</H2>

<P>
Present day telecommunication systems make use of computing technology
that places excessive reliance on specialist equipment and techniques
for delivering core services of switching and call management.
It is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain and enhance
these systems to incorporate new services and functionalities.
Continuing advances in distributed computing technology hold the
promise of a way out of this difficulty. Not surprisingly, industry
led initiatives on distributed systems architecture are examining
approaches to the creation, maintenance and enhancement of telecommunication
services that make use of computing platforms built from commodity
hardware and software. This is easier said than done. It is clear
that the ideas developed within the arena of distributed computing
(e.g., objects interacting via invocations, with dependability
achieved by replication of hardware and software components) will
need considerable refinement before they can be adapted to deliver
the availability as well as the timeliness requirements demanded
by telecommunication services. This observation captures the essence
of our collaborative research effort with industry, for which
we have obtained industrial funding to examine the application
of Arjuna and Voltan technologies. 
<P>
In collaboration with Hewlett-Packard Ltd. (Bristol Research Laboratory),
we are investigating the application of Voltan technology in building
high-availability telecommunications platforms. We are also close
to finalising an agreement with GEC-Plessey Telecommunications
Ltd. to collaborate on the application of Arjuna technology in
structuring call processing software. (See ROPA application form,
section 19 for more details.).
<P>
The work that we have proposed in the previous section is complementary
to the industry funded work described here.
<H2>4. Staffing, Equipment and Travel</H2>

<P>
We are seeking funds for supporting one senior research associate
(Dr. G. D. Parrington). Dr. Parrington has played a key role in
the design, implementation, distribution and maintenance of Arjuna
systems software. He has experience of variety of operating systems
and has skills in computer system management, system integration
and networking. A senior position is being requested as not only
we ourselves have developed large amount of software that we maintain,
distribute, and upgrade, but the kind of work we are proposing
also requires expertise in being able to integrate software developed
by other groups. Some support for secretarial work (arranging
meetings with industrial colleagues etc.) and a technician's time
(equipment maintenance and installation) is also being requested.
On the equipment side we are seeking funds (&#163;53K) for the
purchase of ATM hardware for connecting a cluster of Unix and
PC based workstations and  some 'high-spec' PCs and software detailed
in the application form for constructing our information repository.
ATM hardware is rather expensive at the moment; what we are seeking
is the bare essential. Travel funds (&#163;6k) are being requested
to keep in touch with other research groups in UK, continental
Europe and USA, and for participation at conferences and workshops
(e.g.., Distributed Computing Conference, Fault-tolerant symposium,
Symposium on Operating System Principles, Symp. on Reliable Distributed
Systems, Workshop on the Management of Replicated Data). Finally,
we are seeking funds for equipment maintenance and consumables.
 
<H2>5. Exploitation of Research Results </H2>

<P>
We have excellent contacts with industry and have worked hard
to make our work accessible to them. In addition to the two industrial
contracts, we are in the process of negotiating Arjuna technology
transfer deals with at least two SMEs. We also work closely with
the ANSA laboratory in Cambridge. Newcastle is the co-ordinating
partner for the ESPRIT funded 'distributed computing network of
excellence' scheme (CaberNet) which provides us with a forum for
discussing our work with academic as well  as industrial workers
from all over Europe. We have been distributing Arjuna software
to users all over the world for R&amp;D and teaching purposes
(via WWW server of course!).
