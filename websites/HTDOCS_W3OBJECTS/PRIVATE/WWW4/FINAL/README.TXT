Paper Id#141 WebObjects: Bringing object-oriented technology to the web

As well as the html and gifs I've also included the document in its 
original form, i.e. Word for Windows 6.0a and the diagrams which are
Powerpoint 4. You will probably be able to get better images if
you can go straight from these rather than the gifs.
