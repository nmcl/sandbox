<P>
In <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Consortium/Prospectus/OO.html">an
overview of object oriented technology</A>, Tim Berners-Lee outlines
the main reasons for wanting object technology be used in the WWW.
Taking that document as a starting point, I would like the panel to
discuss the following issues, taking a generally medium-to-long term view:

<OL>
<LH></LH>

<LI>The specific ways in which the WWW will benefit from the
application of object technology.  For example, what new kinds of
applications and facilities can be expected to become available?  How
will these enhance our present ways of working, and what new uses will
object technology enable?

<LI>The infrastructure enhancements that full support for objects will
require, and the best order in which to apply those enhancements.
Does the WWW need to be rebuilt using object technologies, or do those
object technologies need to become adapted to the new environment
which the WWW comprises?

<LI>How to guarantee long-term interoperability between different (and
competing) object technologies, given the fact that not all
commercially available object development systems are interoperable.
What kinds of standards processes will be acceptable and suitable, and
can they move rapidly enough to cope with the development of the WWW?

</OL>

<P>
These and related issues are particularly timely, with work being
done by a variety of groups and a number of commercial object
technologies becoming available for the WWW.
