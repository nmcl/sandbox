WWW4 &quot;The WEB Revolution&quot;
<P>
4th International World-Wide Web Conference
<P>
Draft version, 12 June, 1995
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
web has lead to a vast explosion in use of large-scale electronic
publishing
<P>
critical mass; cross-platform support; easy to publish; excited
users from all professions
<P>
problems with existing technology; numerous groups working on
ad-hoc fixes to specific problems
<P>
incorporating extra functionality into HTTP transport (HTTP-NG,
HTTPS....)
<P>
unwritten premise that resources are read-only; not being addressed
(IETF URN/URC)
<P>
massive growth; manageability will get more difficult
<P>
nature of resources will change; need to incorporate wide range
of entities and services, not just docs
<P>
extensible framework needed, allowing integration of more complex
resources
<P>
object-oriented approach provides key to extensible system
<P>
paper first highlights problems of current web
<P>
discusses how principles of object-orientation can be used to
provide the required extensible framework
<P>
shows how proven results from distributed computing community
research can address shortcomings
<P>
describe our work; principles and implementation; integration:
evolution not revolution
<P>
cf. related work (Hyper-G...)
<P>
conclusions
<H3>Description of shortcomings</H3>

<P>
(Use the 3 category split (user, provider, functional) ?; maybe
better to focus on functional limitations)
<H4>Problems with current web</H4>

<P>
referential integrity; collecting garbage
<P>
migration transparency
<P>
resource unavailability
<P>
resource responsiveness
<P>
resource/server management
<H4>Functional limitations</H4>

<P>
currently focused on read-only documentation resources
<P>
future web will require integration of more complex entities and
services
<P>
current extensibility techniques, although usable (e.g. WebMake)
are clunky
<H3>An object-oriented approach</H3>

<P>
cannot bolt additional functionality into monolithic web daemon
<P>
require extensible system, ability to add object types to servers
<P>
reveal hidden object-orientedness within current web
<P>
distinct set of interfaces possessed by objects
<P>
different classes of object share interfaces;
<P>
encapsulate resources (state + methods)
<P>
interoperability; properties such as conc. control belong to object
not access method
<P>
extensibility through the use of inheritance
<P>
future web resources will have richer interfaces
<P>
multiple interfaces to objects i.e. http access, management, security
<P>
range of implementations of object properties are necessary
<P>
granularity of future web entities will vary widely
<P>
learn from proven results from distributed object-oriented computing
research (Arjuna et al)
<H3>Our Research: WebObjects</H3>

<P>
aim: develop an extensible web architecture based upon the ideas
of object-orientation
<P>
principles: separation of interface/implementation, separation
of data/meta-data
<P>
webobject properties
<P>
justification; based upon current web and predictions of requirements
for future web (read/write; actions etc)
<P>
categorisation (core; common; object dependent)
<P>
discuss properties (naming, referencing, sharing, replication,
caching...)
<P>
implementation strategy based on inheritance; interface/implementation
separation
<P>
our toolbag (Arjuna, Shadows, Gandiva)
<P>
evolutionary integration approach
<P>
[fitting in: need to talk about contexts as URC servers]
<H3>Example: referencing</H3>

<P>
serves two purposes; migration transparency &amp; referential
integrity
<P>
describe key ideas of forward referencing and chain shortcutting
<P>
additional tweaks; proxies, collections
<P>
prototype implementation?
<H3>Related work</H3>

<P>
Hyper-G
<H3>Conclusions</H3>

<P>
Advantages of oo approach
<P>
development plan?
