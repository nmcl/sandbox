<H1>Scaleable Referencing for the Web</H1>

<P>
<B>5th International World-Wide Web Conference, Paris, May 1996</B>
<P>
(Submission date: 29th January 1996)
<H2>Aims</H2>

<UL>
<LI>To provide referential integrity guarantees for W3Objects
(web objects)
<LI>To provide object migration transparency
</UL>

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<P>
(random order brain dump noting Doug Seaton's comments)
<P>
<I>Object owner control must be maintained.</I>
<P>
There will be cases where a referenced object must be removed
for reasons orthogonal to referential integrity. Any proposed
referencing mechanisms should remove this kind of ultimate control
from object owners.
<P>
<I>The system must be robust.</I>
<P>
The conflict between correctness and robustness has to be acknowledged
(blocking forever cannot really be tolerated); complex integrity-preservation
protocols may not operate in the large-scale, heterogeneous, failure-prone
world of the Internet. One of the factors contributing to the
success of the web is the simplicity of the design; stateless
system (clients, servers and protocol).
<H2>Basic Concepts</H2>

<P>
This can be based upon the description from the WWW4 paper.
<H2>Pragmatic Refinements</H2>

<P>
One of the main issues here is to augment the basic referencing
design with features that improve the robustness of the system.
Approaches include:
<UL>
<LI>Collections - structuring technique for organising information,
minimises number of refs
<LI>Proxies - reduce the number of inter-host references
<LI>Alternate reference types - e.g. notification facilities via
call-back using a 2-way reference
</UL>

<H3>Notes</H3>

<P>
<I>URL to Object reference translation</I>
<P>
Since we cannot replace all URLs with object references, we must
deduce the correct way for URL-&gt;reference translation to be
done. The shadows' feature of allowing a reference to contain
multiple paths to the resource (is this implemented?) needs to
be considered; it's my feeling we'll need to use this technique
extensively.
<P>
<I>Client-stub, server-stub matching (?)</I>
<P>
In the current implementation, although this may have now changed
in Shadows, referencing is achieved by pure reference counts,
there is no <I>identity</I> associated with a reference. This
has the potential to cause problems as multiple 'de-reference'
messages via the same reference may cause an object to be incorrectly
collected. I have refreshed my memory of Shapiro's work and SSPs
have this identity property, in that stubs are 'matched' with
their associated scions. From the W3Objects point of view this
is a good property.
<P>
<I>Minimising inter-host references</I>
<P>
We have spoken about using proxies to minimise the number of inter-host
references. Basic SSP also provides this property as the default.
Every reference contained in space A for object o, residing in
space B, passes through the same outgoing stub. That is, in any
given space there is only one stub per object in any remote space.
However,  every incoming reference has a separate scion.
<H2>Comparisons with Competing Technology</H2>

<H3>Hyper-G</H3>

<P>
Hyper-G from Graz, Austria is a fully functioning rival to the
web (in fact it was in existence prior to Tim's creation). Among
the nice features present in Hyper-G are support for referential
integrity, links from arbitrary resources, user-authenticated
access, and efficient searching. Hyper-G's links, which are bi-directional,
are held separate from the resources within which they are held
in local databases. Referential integrity is maintained locally
through the use of the database, if a resource is removed, links
to that resource are also removed. In the wider scale, link update
information is propagated between servers using the p-flood algorithm
which claims to scale well.
<H3>IETF Uniform Resource Name Proposals</H3>

<P>
The decisions about URNs have currently stalled. A number of alternate
mechanisms have been proposed and are currently being implemented
for evaluation. The IETF is not proposing to specify a single
scheme, rather a number of schemes which all provide (at least)
the same lowest-common-denominator functionality.
<P>
URNs are seen to be the solution to migration transparency. We
must compare our scheme and highlight the advantages it offers:
distributed-responsibility, removes name-server bottlenecks, provides
migration transparency with minimal overhead, also addressing
referential integrity problem.
<H3>Microcosm (University of Southampton)</H3>

<P>
(possibly -- need to read latest web-related papers)
<H2>Likely Criticisms</H2>

<P>
The most likely criticism that will be raised will be scaleability.
We will have to work hard to prove that the proposed mechanisms
will scale to a system as large as the current web, which will
only grow over time. How can we prevent the inter-object referencing
descending into an unmanageable chaos. Will an object reference
count ever descend to zero in reality? Are hierarchical or domain
based solutions required?
