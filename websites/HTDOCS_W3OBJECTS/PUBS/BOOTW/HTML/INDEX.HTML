<DT>Abstract:</DT>
<DD>In this paper we discuss some of the problems of the current Web
and show how the introduction of object-orientation provides flexible
and extensible solutions. Web resources become encapsulated as
objects, with well-defined interfaces through which all interactions
occur. The interfaces and their implementations can be inherited by
builders of objects, and methods (operations) can be redefined to
better suit the object. New characteristics, such as concurrency
control and persistence, can be obtained by inheriting from suitable
base classes, without necessarily requiring any changes to users of
these resources. We describe the W3Object model which we have
developed based upon these ideas, and show, through a prototype
implementation, how we have used the model to address the problems of
referential integrity and transparent object (resource) migration. We
also give indications of future work.</DD>

<H2>Introduction</H2>Electronic publishing in the large has grown massively since the advent of the
World Wide Web. Many factors have contributed to its success, in particular,
the simplicity of the system has played a significant role in its acceptance.
Accessing information via the hypertext interface is relatively easy to learn
and use. Becoming a publisher on the Web is also straightforward; users from
all professions have been able to participate, resulting in the huge diversity
of the information currently available. These factors coupled with free Web
software with cross-platform support have helped the Web gain critical mass.
<P>Within the current Web environment, hypertext links are used to glue together
resources which are primarily static, read-only, and file-based (henceforth
referred to as <I>standard resources</I>). Although, the Web has been very
successful in serving such resources, it suffers from a number of shortcomings
and it is questionable whether the current system will be able to scale
indefinitely given the massive growth rates currently being witnessed. In
particular, one highly visible problem is that of broken links between
documents, caused by the lack of referential integrity within the current
hypertext implementation. With the predicted growth in the number of resources,
this problem will increase in significance, and the Web will become more
difficult to use and manage.</P>
<P>The future is also likely to bring new demands on the Web in terms of the types
of resources that it will be required to serve. The Web has proved its
usefulness in the organization of distributed documentation, and users will
wish to access other kinds of resource, with richer interfaces, within the same
environment. Furthermore, service providers will wish to take advantage of the
Web in order to tap the potentially huge customer base.</P>
<P>In this paper, we will show how the current Web implementation is object-based,
with a single interface, comprising the set of HTTP <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> operations. Although
extensions have been implemented to allow the incorporation of <I>nonstandard
resources</I>, it is the opinion of the authors that the system does not
exhibit the necessary extensibility characteristics that are required if the
Web is to cope with the introduction of more advanced resources and services.
We will show how making the change to an object-oriented system can yield an
extensible infrastructure that is capable of supporting existing functionality
and allows the seamless integration of more complex resources and services. We
aim to use proven technical solutions from the distributed object-oriented
community to show how many of the current problems with the Web can be
addressed within the proposed model.</P>
<P>In the next section, a critique of the current Web is presented, highlighting
existing problems in serving standard resources and the current approach for
incorporating nonstandard resources. The section entitled "W3Objects"
describes the W3Object design, its aims, object model, and system
architecture. The "Illustrations" section gives an example, describing how
particular Web shortcomings can be addressed within the proposed architecture.
The remaining sections describe our implementation progress, plans for further
work and concluding remarks.

</P>
<H2>Critique of the Current Web</H2>This section explores some of the problems with the current World Wide Web,
which we have classified into three categories. Firstly, we consider the
problems associated with the primary function of the Web, that is, in serving
standard resources. The current techniques for incorporating nonstandard
resources are then discussed. Finally, the recent proposals for extending the
existing Web model are analyzed and reviewed.


<H3>Serving Standard Resources</H3>Currently the Web is primarily populated with standard resources including
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) <a href="#ref2">[2]</a> documents, GIF images, postscript files,
audio files, etc., with the common characteristics of being passive, read-only,
and static. All resources are currently named using Uniform Resource Locators
(URLs) <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>, a locational naming scheme which describes the protocol used to
access the resource, the Internet address of the server containing the
resource, and the location of the resource within that server. HTML documents
contain hypertext links which are either intraresource, for providing multiple
navigational paths through a document, or interresource, providing the

<I>webglue</I>, allowing related resources to be connected.
<P>One of the major advantages of the Web is the speed and ease by which
information can be made available. In this environment Web resources are
frequently created, moved, and destroyed in an ad-hoc manner, suiting the owner
of the information or publishing site. These changes are usually made
autonomously, with little regard for users of the information. There are three
distinct problems tied together here, namely, referential integrity, migration
transparency, and resource management. Quality of service, which is also
affected by these issues, is also discussed.

</P>
<H4>Referential integrity</H4>A system supports referential integrity if it guarantees that resources will
continue to exist as long as there are outstanding references to the resources.
The Web does not support this property and cannot do so since the system is
unaware of the number of references that exist to a particular resource. 
<P>It is impractical to maintain every resource that has ever been published on a
particular server forever, this simply does not scale. Resources that are no
longer of value, for whatever reason, become garbage and need to be collected.
This may involve moving the resources to backing storage, or in some cases,
deleting the resources entirely. Access pattern information, which is currently
available through examination of server logs, is not a sufficient basis to
decide whether an object is safe to garbage collect as important though rarely
used references to a resource may exist. Safe garbage collection can only be
performed if referencing information is available.</P>
<P>The consequences of deleting resources that are still referenced affects both
the user and the information provider. In the Web environment deleting a
resource that is referenced by another resource results in a broken hypertext
link. Such broken links are the single most annoying problem faced by browsing
users in the current Web. Broken links result in a tarnished reputation for the
provider of the document containing the link, annoyance for the document user,
and possible lost opportunity for the owner of the resource pointed to by the
link.

</P>
<H4>Migration transparency</H4>In addition to the problems associated with deleting Web resources, migrating
resources (either intra- or interserver) also has the potential to break
hypertext links. Using the URL naming scheme, when a resource moves its
identity also changes. Therefore, hypertext links to the old name will now
break, with the same consequences as stated previously.
<P>A partial solution to this problem is provided by the use of the HTTP redirect
directive, which provides a  forwarding pointer to the new location, allowing
clients to rebind to the resource (automatically in the case of
redirection-aware browsers). However, this is only a partial solution for the
following reasons: firstly, documents containing references to the old location
of the resource are not automatically updated, and so future requests will
continue to access the old location first. Secondly, even if there were an
automatic update mechanism, the lack of referential integrity means that the
redirector can never be safely removed since it is impossible to determine
whether all of the links have been updated. There is also the possibility that
the URL may be reallocated following the migration.</P>
<P>The IETF Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Working Group's <a href="#ref4">[4]</a> work on Uniform
Resource Names (URNs) <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>, an alternative naming scheme, based upon logical
rather than locational naming attempts to address the problem of migration
transparency. The mapping from logical name (URN) to locational name (URL) is
stored within a name-server which is updated with the new URL when the
resource moves <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>. The disadvantage of this approach is the performance penalty
associated with name-server lookups, updates, and access bottlenecks.
Furthermore, this scheme does not address the issue of referential integrity.

</P>
<H4>Resource and service management</H4>As previously mentioned, most resource accesses through the Web are read-only
operations. Updates to the resources by the information provider are performed
using mechanisms orthogonal to the Web; that is, using the native commands and
editing tools of the server machine. In effect Web resources reside in two
distinct domains in parallel: the traditional structure of the filesystem and
the complex interlinking Web of hypertext. Within these two environments, the
interfaces to the resources as well as the relationships between the resources
are fundamentally different, as illustrated in Figure 1.
<P><IMG SRC="Figure1.gif"></P>
<P>Figure 1. Disjoint interfaces to Web resources</P>
<P>Maintenance operations carried out by the information provider or site
maintainer typically require manipulation of the resources within both domains.
As described earlier in the section entitled "Migration Transparency," moving a
resource within the file system has the side effect of changing its name in the
Web domain. To reflect such changes, other Web resources must also be modified.
Further, the internal state of the moved resource may also require
modification, due to the use of relative naming <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>. At present such changes
are performed manually and are prone to mistakes and inconsistencies (although
tools, for example, <I>MOMSpider</I> <a href="#ref8">[8]</a> exist to help eventually detect some
of these). This can be seen as a result of having two parallel interfaces
without any support for maintaining consistency.

</P>
<H4>Quality of service</H4>The perceived quality of service (QoS) of the Web is influenced by many
factors, including the broken link problems already mentioned. Even if a user
holds a correct reference to an existing Web resource, it may still be
unavailable due to a number of reasons, including unavailability of the machine
serving the resource, and partitions in the network between the client and
server. Partitions may either be real, caused by breaks in the physical
network, or virtual, due to excessive network or server load making
communications between the client and server impossible. Even if communication
is possible, very poor response characteristics may effectively make the
resource unusable. QoS will become more of an issue as the Web continues its
transformation into a commercially oriented system
<P>Technical solutions for improving QoS are fairly well understood, including
caching for responsiveness, replication for availability, and migration for
load balancing. Caching in the Web is reasonably common, both through the use
of browser memory and disc caches, and also through the use of caching servers
<a href="#ref9">[9]</a>. Effective caching is not a trivial task since there are many subtle
problems that need to be addressed, including cache consistency, accounting,
etc. Current caching servers use a heuristic approach for consistency
management, where resources can only apply coarse-grained tuning based on
expiry dates. The IETF URI working group is implementing a framework for
resource replication, but appear to only be addressing the problem within the
realm of read-only, static resources, where a read-from-any policy is
appropriate <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>. Replicating more complex read/write resources is much more
difficult due to the problems associated with maintaining consistency between
concurrent users and in the presence of failures.

</P>
<H3>Incorporating Nonstandard Resources</H3>Those Web resources which
possess a richer interface than standard resources
are manipulated through the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) protocol  <a href="#ref10">[10]</a>, which
sits above HTTP. Through this protocol it is possible to perform arbitrary
operations, not supported directly by HTTP, on these resources. Such resources
are still identified by URLs, but the HTTP daemon is able to distinguish CGI
URLs from standard resources. Upon receiving a request containing a CGI URL,
rather than dealing with the request itself the daemon invokes a CGI

<I>script</I>identified in the URL. Additional parameters can be included in
the URL, which the daemon passes directly to the script, to be used in an
application specific manner in the servicing of the request. When the script
finishes the request it returns a reply message to the client and terminates.
<P>Unlike publishing standard resources, writing CGI scripts is not simple; the
resources manipulated need no longer be read-only and the issues
involved in interacting with them are much more complex. There is no support
for controlled sharing of resources, and because HTTP is still the underlying
communication protocol, connections between client and resource last only for
each request. This forces users to adopt ad-hoc solutions to problems such as
persistence, concurrency control, and sharing of resources between requests.

</P>
<H3>Extending the Model</H3>The HTTP protocol specifies the operations a client can attempt to perform on a
Web resource; for example GET, POST, etc. There is also support for an

<I>extension method</I>, which allows user-specific operations to be added to
the protocol. Resource providers who wish to use this feature, must liaise with
the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to register these operations.
The IETF have also proposed new standard methods to be incorporated into HTTP
in response to user requests <a href="#ref11">[11]</a>. Irrespective of the approach used to add new
methods to the protocol, changes will be required to both the daemon and
browsers. Further, the new methods may be inappropriate for the majority of Web
resources and there will still be requirements which they do not address.
This will result in a further round of protocol negotiations and changes to Web
software. There is a long lead time involved between initial method proposals
and final implementations.
<P>The result of this model and the constraints it imposes are that people may
change the daemons in an ad-hoc manner. This makes migration of Web resources
from modified daemons difficult because modifications need to be made to every
daemon which services them. There is also no easy route for code reuse, leading
to individuals implementing similar methods in different ways.

</P>
<H3>Conclusions</H3>From an object perspective, the HTTP daemon provides a single interface through
which all objects it manages are accessed. In effect, the current Web may be
viewed as an object-based system with a single class of object. What is desired
is the ability to modify this interface on a per-resource basis. Within the
object-oriented paradigm such specializations are achieved through the use of
inheritance, and it is the absence of this which distinguishes an object-based
from an object-oriented system <a href="#ref12">[12]</a>.
<P>We believe that the model and implementation we shall present in this paper
represent a cleaner way of addressing the issues of flexibility and
extensibility in a uniform manner, and can be used to provide solutions to the
problems highlighted earlier. They can also be applied to the current Web with
little or no modifications to users of these resources, and minor requirements
from their providers. In the following sections we will describe our model and
illustrate it with an implementation which supports referential integrity and
transparent object migration.

</P>
<H2>W3Objects</H2>The primary objective of our research is to develop an extensible Web
infrastructure which is able to support a wide range of resources and services.
Our model makes extensive use of the concepts of object-orientation to achieve
the necessary extensibility characteristics. Within this object-oriented
framework, proven concepts from the distributed object-oriented community will
be applied to the problems currently facing the Web.
<P>The next section introduces our object model, describing how the principles of
object-orientation are applied to the Web domain. The interactions between the
system components are described in the section entitled "System Architecture,"
which is followed by a section entitled "W3Object Properties" which classifies
and describes a collection of properties applicable to different classes of
W3Object.

</P>
<H3>Object Model</H3>In the proposed model, Web resources are transformed from file-based resources
into objects, 
<I>W3Objects</I>. W3Objects are 
<I>encapsulated</I>resources
possessing internal state and a well-defined behavior. The objects themselves
are responsible for managing their own state transitions and properties, in
response to method invocations. This model supports 
<I>abstraction</I>since
clients only interact with W3Objects through the published interfaces; the
implementation of a particular operation is not externally visible.
<P>Different classes of W3Object support different operational interfaces, which
are obtained through the use of <I>interface inheritance</I>. Abstract classes
are used to define an interface to a particular object abstraction, without
specifying any particular implementation of the operations. Different classes
of W3Objects may share conformance to a particular abstract interface, but may
implement the operations differently, in a manner appropriate to the particular
class. For example, consider a <TT>Manageable</TT> interface, including a <TT>migrate</TT>
operation, for moving objects from one location to another. While the same
interface is appropriate for many classes of W3Objects, the implementations may
differ; for example, migration of a hypertext object may require some internal
link manipulation operations in addition to the operations required by, say, a
text file.</P>
<P>The use of interface inheritance provides <I>polymorphism</I>; that is, all
derived classes that conform to an interface provided by some base class may be
treated as instances of that base class, without regard for any other aspects
of that class' behavior. Continuing with the previous example, consider a
dedicated GUI-based Website management tool, providing a graphical interface
for performing management-style operations on the objects; one such operation
may be object migration. The management tool is able to abstract away from
other features of the different objects (supported through various other
interfaces) and simply address all of the different objects as instances of the
<TT>Manageable</TT> interface.
In addition to inheritance of interface, the model also supports <I>behavioral
inheritance</I>, thereby supporting code reuse. For example, object properties
such as persistence and concurrency control may be provided by <I>mixin</I>base classes to be inherited as required. Mix-in classes are not designed to
be instantiated themselves. They are used to augment the functionality of the
derived class, by providing some particular behavior, usually orthogonal to the
primary function of the class.</P>
<P>The diagram in Figure 2 illustrates the key points of our object model by
showing how two example W3Object classes, <TT>Spreadsheet</TT> and Play, are composed
using both interface and behavioral inheritance. The abstract class, <TT>Manageable</TT>
provides the interface description for management-style operations (only a
single operation, <TT>migrate</TT>, is shown). Both of the derived classes inherit this
interface, providing their own implementations. In addition, both of the
derived classes provide other interfaces, describing the primary operations of
the classes. The <TT>Play</TT> class, representing a theatrical performance, provides a
<TT>bookSeat</TT> operation, and <TT>Spreadsheet</TT> provides <TT>get</TT> and <TT>set</TT> operations for
manipulating the contents of the spreadsheet cells. Further, the <TT>Spreadsheet</TT>
class is concurrency controlled, having derived this property from the mixin
class, <TT>ConcControllable</TT>. The operations <TT>setLock</TT> and <TT>releaseLock</TT> are used in the
implementation of the <TT>get</TT> and <TT>set</TT> operations to ensure the integrity of the
spreadsheet in the event of concurrent access.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Figure2.gif"></P>
<P>Figure 2. Illustration of using the object model</P>
<P>Also shown in the diagram are three different clients which manipulate
instances of <TT>Play</TT> and <TT>Spreadsheet</TT>. A Website management tool, previously
mentioned, is solely concerned with the operations provided through the
<TT>Manageable</TT> interface. The tool is able to invoke the <TT>migrate</TT> operation on
instances of either derived class without knowledge of the nature of the class.
Two further clients are shown, a theatre booking application and a spreadsheet
tool, which manipulate instances of <TT>Play</TT> and <TT>Spreadsheet</TT> respectively. The fact
that these classes also conform to the Manageable interface is of no
consequence to the clients who only interact with the objects via the
interfaces supporting the classes' primary function.

</P>
<H3>System Architecture</H3>In common with the current Web, the proposed W3Object architecture consists of
three basic entity types, namely, clients, servers, and published objects. In
the current Web environment, these three types correspond to Web browsers (e.g.,
mosaic), Web daemons (e.g., CERN HTTPD), and documentation resources (e.g., HTML
documents) respectively. Our architecture supports both client-object
(client-server), and interobject (peer-to-peer) communication.


<H4>Client-object interactions</H4>Figure 3 illustrates, the logical view of client-object interactions within the
W3Object architecture. A single server process is shown, managing a single
W3Object
<SUP> </SUP>(although servers are capable of managing multiple objects
of different types), which is being accessed via two different clients, a
standard Web browser, and a dedicated bespoke application. This diagram
highlights 
<I>interoperability</I>as one of the key concepts of the
architecture, that is, the support for object accessibility via different
applications using multiple protocols.
<P><IMG SRC="Figure3.gif"></P>
<P><B>Figure 3. Client-object interactions</B></P>
<P>As stated earlier, W3Objects are encapsulated, meaning that they are
responsible for managing their own properties (e.g., security, persistence,
concurrency control etc.) rather than the application accessing the object. For
example, in the case of concurrency, the object manages its own access control,
based upon its internal policy, irrespective of which application method
invocations originate from.</P>
<P>The local representation of an object, together with the available operations,
may vary depending upon the particular type of client accessing it. The Web
browser uses a URL to bind to the particular object in the server. The
operations that are permitted on the object, via the URL, are defined by the
HTTP protocol. The HTTP communication end-point of the server may perform name
mapping between URL and the internal name for the object and may also map HTTP
requests to appropriate method invocations on the object. Within the bespoke
application, a client-stub object acts as the local representation of the
remote object. From the point of view of the application, this stub object
presents the illusion that the remote object is actually within the address
space of the client. Like any other object, the stub presents a well-defined
interface describing the supported operations. This interface has the potential
to be much richer than that provided through HTTP, including application
specific operations. Operation invocations on the stub are passed to the object
using the remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. Client-stub objects may be
automatically generated from a description of an object interface. Our
implementation uses C++ as the definition language and we provide
stub-generation support for creating client and server side stubs which handle
operation invocation and parameter marshalling <a href="#ref13">[13]</a>. Other possible interface
definition languages are possible, including CORBA IDL  <a href="#ref14">[14]</a> and ILU ISL
<a href="#ref15">[15]</a>.</P>
<P>Continuing with the previous example of a Web-based theatre booking
application; to support access via conventional browsers using HTTP, the
theatre object would conform to an <TT>HTTP</TT> interface, supporting an operation,
say, <TT>htmlGet</TT>. An HTTP GET request from the browser would be mapped to an
invocation of the <TT>htmlGet</TT> method of the object. Through this limited interface,
the programme of events and availability information may be available. A
client-stub object for the theatre may support more advanced operations such as
seat booking using <I>atomic actions</I> (<I>transactions</I>).</P>
<P>Although not illustrated, a number of other client implementations are
possible. The common gateway interface (CGI) could be used to provide a richer
client-side interface than is readily available through HTTP. Although, it has
been already stated that we believe CGI to be too low-level for direct
programming, CGI interfaces to remote objects can be automatically created
using stub-generation tools. We have implemented a basic stub-generator, which
uses an abstract definition of the remote object, and ANSA have recently
released a more complete tool <a href="#ref16">[16]</a> based on CORBA IDL. Recent developments
using interpreted languages within the Web, including Java  <a href="#ref17">[17]</a> and SafeTcl
 <a href="#ref18">[18]</a> are potentially very useful for developing client-side interfaces to
W3Objects. Using such languages, complex, architecture-neutral, front-ends
dedicated to a particular W3Object class can be developed, supporting rich
sets of operations.

</P>
<H4>Inter-object interactions</H4>In addition to client-object communication, our architecture also supports
inter-object communication, regardless of the objects' location. In effect, the
architecture may be viewed as a single distributed service, partitioned over
different hosts as illustrated in Figure 4. Inter-object communication is used
for a variety of purposes, including referencing, migration, caching, and
replication.
<P><IMG SRC="Figure4.gif"></P>
<P><B>Figure 4. Inter-object interactions</B></P>
<P>In addition to W3Objects, servers may contain W3Object stubs, or
aliases, which are named objects that simply forward operation invocations to
another object, transparently to clients. One particular use of aliases is in
implementation of name-servers, since a name-server may be viewed simply as a
collection of named objects which alias other objects with alternative names
(server S1 in diagram). Objects may also contain stubs to other objects (shown
in S2 in diagram). This feature is used in our implementation of referencing,
which is described further in the "Illustrations" section.

</P>
<H4>Implementation considerations</H4>As previously mentioned, a particular W3Object server is capable of holding
W3Objects belonging to a set of specific types. At the time it is created, it
is unlikely that one can predict all of the object types that a particular
server will be required to serve over its lifetime. This raises the question
of how new types are introduced to the system. The usual approach is to bring
down a server, rebuild it with the code which supports the new object types,
and then restart it. This approach is less than ideal for an application such
as the Web where there is a requirement for keeping downtime to a minimum. An
alternative technique relies on 
<I>dynamic loading</I>, which allows an active
process to load new code as necessary. Although this approach is clearly more
elegant and we do not preclude its use, dynamic loaders currently suffer from
lack of standardization and therefore portability. A third, more pragmatic,
approach is to create another server to support the new object types. This
approach may be desirable even if suitable dynamic loading support is available
due to requirements for fault tolerance and security because, as a single
server for all object types is a single point of failure,  multiple servers can
be used to protect users against such failures.
<P>One method of interfacing with multiple servers is to make use of an HTTP
Gateway, which uses stub objects to forward object invocations through to the
appropriate server. The gateway is transparent to clients accessing the
objects; incoming requests are simply forwarded to the destination object,
which parses the request and replies accordingly. This is illustrated in Figure
5, in which server S1 manages a number of different types of object
(illustrated by different shapes) and server S2 manages objects of a single
type. As the processing of operations is entirely the responsibility of the
individual object, the introduction of new object types  is transparent to
the gateway.</P>

</P>
<H3>W3Object Properties</H3>Based on critiques of the current Web by ourselves and others
<a href="#ref19">[19]</a>, and also
our experience with distributed systems in general, we have attempted to
identify the set of properties that are required by W3Objects. We have
classified these properties into three categories: core properties, common
properties, and class-specific properties. In this section we shall present
what we believe to be the core properties required by all W3Objects and give
examples of some common properties.


<H4>Core properties</H4>Four properties have been identified as being the core requirements for
W3Objects: Naming, Sharing, Mobility, and Referencing. The implementation of
these properties is divided between the objects themselves and the supporting
infrastructure which manages the objects. Each property will be considered in
turn.
<P><I>Naming</I>: One of the fundamental concepts of the object-oriented
paradigm is identity. The ability to name an object is required in order to
unambiguously communicate with and about it. Context-relative naming is an
essential feature of our environment so as to support interoperability and
scalability. As mentioned previously, different clients may use different
local representations of a remote object (URLs, client-stub objects, etc.).
Since it is impractical to impose new naming conventions on existing systems,
we require the ability to translate names between system-boundaries.
Furthermore, for extensibility, we need to be able to incorporate new naming
systems. Within our design, naming is provided via the object infrastructure.
Context-relative naming is supported via the use of name-servers, implemented
as collections of object aliases, as described previously.</P>
<P><I>Sharing</I>: Implicit within the Web domain is the requirement that
objects can be shared. Although the basic function of allowing multiple users
to interact with objects is simple to achieve, there are a number of other
associated mechanisms that require interaction with the base sharing
functionality. Access control, either user and group based, or access
restriction based on the location of the client, are both likely requirements.
Additionally, with objects supporting a rich set of interfaces, the granularity
of the control must be configurable.</P>
<P><I>Mobility</I>: One of the lessons learned from the current Web is that
support for object mobility is a necessary requirement for W3Objects. At
object creation time, migration of the object may not be envisaged, but it is
virtually impossible to predict the future requirements of a particular object.
Mobility may be required for many reasons, including load balancing, caching,
and improved performance through locality etc., with different forms of
migration, including intra- or inter-host.</P>
<P><I>Referencing</I>: In order to address what may be viewed as the
primary problem with the current Web, namely referential integrity, we believe
that low-level referencing support is required by all objects. A range of
schemes is possible, including forward referencing <a href="#ref20">[20]</a>, call-backs, and
redirection through a location server (as in the URN approach). Referencing is
closely related to mobility, since referencing schemes may be used to locate
objects even in the event of object migration. Our approach to referencing is
described in detail in the "Illustrations" section.

</P>
<H4>Common properties</H4>There are a potentially large number of common properties for W3Objects which
can be encapsulated within appropriate base classes. In the rest of this
section we shall highlight four of these properties which we have selected
based upon our experience of building reliable distributed systems <a href="#ref21">[21]</a>
<P><I>Replication</I>: There is a range of replication protocols from
active to passive, and strong consistency to weak consistency. There is no
single replication protocol which is suitable for every object which may need
to be replicated and at the same time can satisfy a user's required quality of
service <a href="#ref22">[22]</a>. As such, it is our intention to implement a suitable base class
for object providers, which will enable them to select the appropriate
replication protocol on a per object basis. In addition object providers will
also be able to select the optimum number and location of these replicas, and
modify this as required <a href="#ref23">[23]</a>.</P>
<P><I>Concurrency control</I>: By enabling users to share arbitrary objects
it may be necessary for these object state transitions to be managed through an
appropriate concurrency control mechanism. Consider the theatre booking example
earlier: if user A wishes to examine the seats which are available while user
B is in the process of booking a seat, it would be desirable for B to lock the
seat in order to prevent conflicting updates. There are a number of concurrency
control mechanisms available, but our initial implementation will be based upon
the familiar multiple reader, single writer policy.</P>
<P><I>Caching</I>: The caching of object states, either at or close to
users, can help alleviate problems of network congestion and latency. However,
as with replication, there is a need for a range of caching policies based
upon user requirements and object properties.</P>
<P><I>Fault tolerance</I>: In a large-scale distributed system,
fault tolerance is an important property. One way of addressing the issues of
fault tolerance is by using atomic actions to control method invocations.
Objects inherit necessary persistence and concurrency control characteristics,
and application programmers then manipulate these objects within atomic actions
which guarantee the usual ACID properties.

</P>
<H2>Illustrations</H2>Having described our model in the previous sections, we shall now illustrate
how two of the core properties, referencing and mobility, are implemented
within the model. Our aim is to address the current problem of broken links and
provide transparent object migration.


<H3>Referential Integrity</H3>In our model Web resources are represented as W3Objects and may be referenced
from some 
<I>root</I>, either directly, via W3Object stubs, or by being
contained within another W3Object (note that W3Object stubs are themselves
W3Objects). This is illustrated in Figure 6, which shows a number of objects,
all of which are reachable from some roots.
<P>Our service maintains the distributed referencing graph and uses reference
counting to detect unreferenced objects. Stubs, when created, perform an
explicit <I>bind</I> operation on the object they refer to (thereby
incrementing the object's reference count)  and perform an <I>unbind</I>
operation whenever the stub is deleted (thereby decrementing the count).</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Figure6.gif"></P>
<P>Figure 6. Object referencing</P>
<P>Reference from a root represents the service[[Otilde&#93;&#93;s continued
interest in the object while stubs represent hypertext links from one object to
another. Therefore an object is not available for deletion until (1) the service
has expressed its lack of further interest in the object (by no longer
referencing it from a root) and (2) there are no hypertext links from other
objects. Once these conditions are met the object is marked as unreferenced and
is available for deletion.

</P>
<H3>Migration Transparency</H3>An object may be moved from one location to another (potentially to some remote
site). Our service guarantees that object moves are transparent to all other
objects i.e., references to the moved object continue to be valid. Whenever an
object is moved a stub representing the object is left behind at the old
location and this automatically forwards invocations (without involving the
invoker) to the new location. Further moves of the object may cause a chain of
such stubs to be created (in a similar manner to that used by SSP chains <a href="#ref20">[20]</a>,
leading ultimately to the real object. For example, in Figure 7, object Y has
been moved, first to server B, and then subsequently to server C, leaving
behind the forwarding chain shown. Whenever an invocation follows such a chain
these indirections are short-cut i.e., the invoker[[Otilde&#93;&#93;s stub communicates
directly with the W3Object at the new location. Following a short cut
intermediate stubs which are no longer referenced are automatically garbage
collected.
<P><IMG SRC="Figure7.gif"></P>
<P>Figure 7. Referencing chains</P>
<P>Using the short-cutting mechanism stubs will in general point directly
at their W3Object; however, there may be circumstances where the chain becomes
longer than is desirable, i.e., the Object moves a number of times between
invocations from a particular stub. Long chains have more points of failure and
a performance cost in the necessary indirections at invocation time, and
consequently there may be situations in which long chains are to be avoided.
Therefore as an extension to our basic forwarding location mechanism we allow
stubs to register callbacks with objects such that, whenever an object moves,
the registered stubs are automatically informed of the move. These stubs may
either represent hypertext links from other resources and/or belong to a
location service which offers the current position of the object to any of its
users. More details are given in <a href="#ref24">[24]</a>.</P>
<P>Our use of forward references is an entirely distributed solution which scales
well by not relying on centralized location services or broadcasts of moves, as
is proposed by Hyper-G <a href="#ref25">[25]</a>. Hyper-G ensures that all references to all
resources are (eventually) updated to reflect any movement, but this requires
additional network traffic that may be appropriate for individual enterprises
but does not scale to a worldwide solution. Our system also guarantees that
any object movement is transparent to any reference holder and does not require
the handling of object faults and subsequent rebinding. Our policy is to
provide inexpensive forward referencing (which introduces no extra network
traffic when an object is moved) as the default location service but to offer
alternative, potentially more expensive solutions such as callback and the use
of location servers for resources with specific performance or fault-tolerance
requirements. Our model allows the choice of appropriate location mechanisms
for an application and the ability to vary that choice at run-time as
required.</P>
<P>The mechanisms described above offer a consistent view of referencing within
the system so long as (1) neither the referenced objects or their stubs can be
lost through failures and (2) the bind and unbind operations are totally
reliable. We guarantee that W3Objects and stubs recover from failures by
saving them on stable store i.e., a file system. The bind and unbind operations
use an RPC to access the W3Object, which may be held within a remote server
(optimized to a local procedure call whenever the object is held in the same
server). Our remote object-invocation layer guarantees "at-most-once" semantics
for the RPC; i.e., despite failures operations will eventually be performed.

</P>
<H2>Implementation Progress</H2>Using Shadows, a lightweight object support system <a href="#ref26">[26]</a>,
we have begun the implementation of the core W3Object properties, concentrating initially on
referential integrity and object mobility. During this prototyping stage, we
have developed a system which operates in parallel with conventional HTTP
daemons. Therefore, object states are stored in their native formats, (e.g.,
HTML files, etc.) and are available for direct manipulation through the standard
file system and Web interfaces. The advantage of this approach is that we are
able to develop and test our design without requiring site maintainers to alter
any aspect of their existing Web configurations. The disadvantage is the
inherent loose coupling between the two systems, requiring users to register
entities with our service and be sufficiently disciplined so as not to delete
entities directly through the file system without consulting the service.
Following this prototyping stage we will introduce the HTTP Gateway and provide
user-level tools to replace the direct manipulation of the object through the
file system, without restricting the use of any existing resource manipulation
tools, e.g., text editors.
<P>In the prototype system, an additional daemon per host is used to provide the
referencing service, which is administered using a GUI-based tool. This tool
allows the site maintainer to browse through the entities currently being
served by the HTTP daemon and to <I>include</I> them within the service. On
being instructed to include a Web entity, the service creates a corresponding
W3Object which is <I>registered</I>, causing it to be referenced from a root
and thereby ensuring it is not immediately marked as unreferenced. The
administration tool then parses the resource to identify any hypertext links it
contains. If the links point to resources already included in the service, then
references to their corresponding objects are created and stored within the
newly created object, thereby extending the referencing graph. Links to
resources not already within the service are reported back to the user who then
has the option to explicitly include them if they are under his control. A
<I>deregister</I> operation is used to express the site maintainer's lack of
further interest in a resource which causes the reference count for the
resource to be decremented. If the reference count reaches zero the site
maintainer is informed that it is available for deletion. If the site
maintainer confirms it is to be deleted then the W3Object is removed from the
service and the corresponding resource removed from the file system. Deleting
an object may result in the reference counts of other objects being
decremented, i.e., those referenced from the deleted object.</P>
<P>The site maintainer may <I>move</I> a resource from one location to another
(potentially to some remote site where the resource may come under new
ownership). In addition to moving the object through the process described in
the previous section, the service performs the following operations: (1) the
resource is removed from the file system, (2) an HTTP redirector is inserted, (3)
all relative URLs contained within the moving resource are transformed, and (4)
the resource is placed in the file system at the new location.</P>
<P>The next stage of our development is to implement the full W3Object model as
described in this paper, integrating the referencing work with other software
subsystems developed locally as part of the Arjuna Project <a href="#ref27">[27]</a>. To provide
the flexibility and extensibility we have described, we shall make use of the
Gandiva system <a href="#ref28">[28]</a> which supports the separation of object interfaces from
implementation, and enables reconfiguration of this relationship without
requiring the rebuilding of objects or applications. For the common W3Object
properties we will make use of the work developed for the Arjuna system <a href="#ref21">[21]</a>,
which provides the necessary fault-tolerance and replication support.

</P>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>As a way of serving standard resources, the Web has proven extremely successful
but still suffers from a number of shortcomings. Furthermore, in order to cope
with new resource types the Web needs improved flexibility and extensibility
characteristics. We have illustrated how the application of the concepts of
object-orientation can achieve these extensibility requirements and how
problems, such as the lack of referential integrity, can be addressed through
the application of techniques developed by the distributed object research
community.
<P>The W3Object model, presented in this paper, is intended to provide a flexible
and extensible way of building Web applications, where Web resources are
encapsulated as objects with well-defined interfaces. Objects inherit desirable
characteristics, redefining operations as is appropriate; users interact with
these objects in a uniform manner. We have identified three categories of
object properties: core, common, and specific, and have described an
implementation using the core properties which addresses what we believe to be
one of the most significant problems facing the current Web--that of
referential integrity. A key feature of our design is support for
interoperability; for example, in addition to sophisticated clients which may
use the rich object interfaces that our model provides, our implementation will
also allow W3Objects to continue to be accessed using existing Web browsers.
