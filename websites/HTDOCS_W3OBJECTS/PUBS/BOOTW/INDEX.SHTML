<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>In this paper we discuss some of the problems of the current web
and show how the introduction of object-orientation provides flexible
and extensible solutions. Web resources become encapsulated as
objects, with well-defined interfaces through which all interactions
occur. The interfaces and their implementations can be inherited by
builders of objects, and methods (operations) can be redefined to
better suit the object. New characteristics, such as concurrency
control and persistence, can be obtained by inheriting from suitable
base classes, without necessarily requiring any changes to users of
these resources. We describe the W3Object model which we have
developed based upon these ideas, and show, through a prototype
implementation, how we have used the model to address the problems of
referential integrity and transparent object (resource) migration. We
also give indications of future work.</P>
