<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The Web frequently suffers from failures which affect
the performance and consistency of applications run over it. An
important fault-tolerance technique is the use of atomic actions
(atomic transactions) for controlling operations on services. Atomic
actions guarantee the consistency of applications despite concurrent
accesses and failures. Techniques for implementing transactions on
distributed objects are well-known: in order to become
&quot;transaction aware&quot;, an object requires facilities for
concurrency control, persistence, and the ability to participate in a
commit protocol. While it is possible to make server-side applications
transactional, browsers typically do not possess such facilities, a
situation which is likely to persist for the foreseeable
future. Therefore, the browser will not normally be able to take part
in transactional applications. The paper presents a design and
implementation of a scheme that does permit non-transactional browsers
to participate in transactional applications, thereby providing much
needed end-to-end transactional guarantees. </I>

<H2>Introduction </H2>

<P>The Web is rapidly being populated by service providers who wish to
sell their products to a large potential customer base. However, there
are still important security and fault-tolerance considerations which must
be addressed. One of these is the fact that the Web frequently suffers
from failures which can affect both the performance and consistency of
applications run over it. For example, if a user purchases a cookie granting
access to a newspaper site, it is important that the cookie is delivered
and stored if the user's account is debited; a failure could prevent either
from occurring, and leave the system in an indeterminate state. For resources
such as documents, failures may simply be annoying to users; for commercial
services, they can result in loss of revenue and credibility. Therefore,
making Web applications fault-tolerant is important. </P>

<P><I>Atomic actions</I> (<I>atomic transactions</I>) are a well-known
technique for guaranteeing application consistency in the presence of failures
[<A HREF="#LOMET">1</A>][<A HREF="#OTS">2</A>]. An atomic action guarantees
that, despite failures, either all of the work conducted within its scope
will be performed or it will all be undone. This is an extremely useful
fault-tolerance technique, especially when multiple, possibly remote, transactional
resources are involved. For this reason Web applications already exist
which offer transactional guarantees to users. However, because significant
resources are required to provide transactional properties, these guarantees
only extend to resources used at Web servers, or between servers (see figure
1); browsers are not included, despite being a significant source of unreliability
in the Web. Providing end-to-end transactional integrity between the browser
and the application is important, however: in the previous example, the
cookie <I>must</I> be delivered once the user's account has been debited.
As we shall show later, using cgi-scripts cannot provide this level of
transactional integrity since replies sent after the transactions have
completed may be lost, and replies sent during the transaction may need
to be revoked if the transaction cannot complete successfully [<A HREF="#OSF">3</A>].

<CENTER><P>Figure 1: Current transactional Web applications. </P></CENTER>

<P>Despite the advent of technologies such as Java, browsers are typically
resource scarce; requiring a browser to incorporate support for transactions
for all applications would be inefficient, and impose an overhead on all
users. In this paper we shall present a lightweight solution for providing
these end-to-end transactional guarantees which does not require the browser
to be transactional. We shall also present an implementation of this model,
the <I>W3OTrans</I> toolkit, which has been implemented on the <I>W3Objects</I>
object-oriented framework [<A HREF="#W3OBJECTS1">4</A>]. </P>

<H2>Atomic actions </H2>

<P>Atomic actions are used in application programs to control the manipulation
of persistent (long-lived) objects. Atomic actions have the following ACID
properties [<A HREF="#OTS">2</A>]: </P>

<UL>
<LI><I>Atomic</I>: if interrupted by failure, all effects are undone (rolled
back).</LI>

<LI><I>Consistent</I>: the effects of a transaction preserve invariant
properties. </LI>

<LI><I>Isolated</I>: a transaction's intermediate states are not visible
to other transactions. Transactions appear to execute serially, even if
they are performed concurrently. </LI>

<LI><I>Durable</I>: the effects of a completed transaction are persistent;
they are never lost (except in a catastrophic failure). </LI>
</UL>

<P>A transaction can be terminated in two ways: committed or aborted (rolled
back). When a transaction is committed, all changes made within it are
made durable (forced on to stable storage, e.g., disk). When a transaction
is aborted, all of the changes are undone. Atomic actions can also be nested;
the effects of a nested action are provisional upon the commit/abort of
the outermost (<I>top-level</I>) atomic action. </P>

<H3>Commit protocol </H3>

<P>A two-phase commit protocol is required to guarantee that all of the
action participants either commit or abort any changes made. Figure 2 illustrates
the main aspects of the commit protocol: during phase 1, the action coordinator,
C, attempts to communicate with all of the action participants, A and B,
to determine whether they will commit or abort. An abort reply from any
participant acts as a veto, causing the entire action to abort. Based upon
these (lack of) responses, the coordinator arrives at the decision of whether
to commit or abort the action. If the action will commit, the coordinator
records this decision on stable storage, and the protocol enters phase
2, where the coordinator forces the participants to carry out the decision.
The coordinator also informs the participants if the action aborts.</P>

<P>When each participant receives the coordinator's phase 1 message, they
record sufficient information on stable storage to either commit or abort
changes made during the action. After returning the phase 1 response, each
participant which returned a commit response <I>must</I> remain blocked
until it has received the coordinator's phase 2 message. Until they receive
this message, these resources are unavailable for use by other actions.
If the coordinator fails before delivery of this message, these resources
remain blocked. However, if crashed machines eventually recover, crash
recovery mechanisms can be employed to unblock the protocol and terminate
the action. </P>

<CENTER><P>Figure 2: Two-phase commit protocol. </P></CENTER>

<H3>Transactional proxies </H3>

<P>The action coordinator maintains a <I>transaction context</I> where
resources taking part in the action are required to be registered. Such
a resource must obey the transaction commit protocol guaranteeing ACID
properties; typically this means that the resource will provide specific
operations which the action can invoke during the commit/abort protocol.
However, it may not be possible to make all resources transactional in
this way, e.g., legacy code which cannot be modified. To use these resources
within an action it is often possible to provide <I>transactional proxies</I>:
the proxy is registered with, and manipulated by, the action as though
it were a transactional resource, and the proxy performs implementation
specific work to make the resource it represents transactional. This requires
that the proxy participate within the commit/abort protocol. Because the
work of the proxy is performed as part of the action, it is guaranteed
to be completed or undone despite failures of the action coordinator or
action participants.</P>

<P>How proxies are created and registered with an action will depend upon
specifics of the transactional system, (some systems may not support proxies).
For example, a system based on reflective techniques may use an appropriate
meta-object protocol [<A HREF="#RJS95">5</A>]. Another technique would
be through the use of <I>open commit protocols</I>, which give programmers
the ability to control what an action participant does during <I>each</I>
phase of the protocol; such a protocol can also be used to register resources
which are not transactional but which can be driven by the commit/abort
protocol [<A HREF="#OTS">2</A>].</P>

<H3><A NAME="Transactional gateways and browser"></A>Transactional gateways
and browser proxies</H3>

<P>One straightforward way to provide end-to-end transactional integrity
for a Web application and its users would be to empower the browser and
incorporate into it transactional objects which are part of the application.
These objects would then be able to participate directly in the application's
transactions. For instance, the newspaper example could place a transactional
object within the browser which has operations for adding and removing
the cookie. However, this then requires the browser to support transactional
objects and (distributed) atomic actions. Although this may be acceptable
for some applications, we are interested in the case where it would be
considered either undesirable or impractical, e.g., because of security
considerations.</P>

<P>For such cases, a practical means of obtaining transactional guarantees
between the application and browser will be through the use of <I>transactional
gateways</I> and <I>transactional</I> <I>browser proxies</I>. A transactional
gateway provides browsers with access to the transactional application
by exporting application specific operations which can be invoked from
the browser, e.g., an operation to purchase the newspaper. Importantly,
an application may be accessed via many gateways: each gateway is configured
to be used by browsers with specific functionality. For example, a gateway
for transactional aware browsers may download transactional application
objects to it; however, if the browser is not transactional, the gateway
may be responsible for creating a transactional browser proxy, which is
then responsible for cooperating with the browser to make it transactional,
as described below. The gateway can also be made responsible for enforcing
security, such as authenticating the user before allowing operations to
be performed. </P>

<P>A transactional browser proxy consists of code which resides within
the browser and code which resides in the gateway. The proxy is used to
allow a non-transactional browser to participate within an atomic action.
The gateway receives a request from a browser, starts an atomic action
and registers a browser proxy with it. The gateway then performs the operation,
gives the result to the proxy, and depending upon the outcome of the operation,
either commits or aborts the action. During the commit/abort protocol the
proxy delivers the response to the browser, which must acknowledge receipt.
For example, in the case of the newspaper example described earlier, the
proxy can transmit the cookie to the browser during phase 2 of the protocol,
when the action has guaranteed that all other changes have been committed,
and the application can be sure that it will be delivered despite failures.
If the action aborts, the proxy can transmit an error message, giving the
reason for the failure. </P>

<P>The server-side of the proxy performs most of the transactional work,
whereas the browser code is relatively simple, needing only to be able
to make any &quot;changes&quot; permanent in the case of a commit, or to
undo them if the action aborts. This will typically be application specific,
e.g., for a cookie, the browser-side proxy will need to write it to disk,
whereas if the user is purchasing a specific edition of an electronic newspaper
the proxy may receive the newspaper during phase 1, and either display
it during phase 2 or discard it, depending upon whether the action commits
or aborts. Therefore, transactional gateways and browser proxies provide
a lightweight means for applications to gain end-to-end transactional integrity.
</P>

<P>A browser proxy can also support application specific processing; we
give two examples below: </P>

<UL>
<LI>if the browser is invoked during phase 1 of the commit protocol and
does not respond (e.g., to a simple &quot;are-you-alive?&quot; message),
the proxy can cause the action to abort. If the action aborts, all of the
other work performed within the action will be automatically undone. This
enables the application to detect browser failures as late as possible,
while still being able to undo any other work performed within the action,
such as aborting a debit of the user's account. If this did not occur,
resources may remain unavailable until crash recovery mechanisms complete
the transaction.</LI>

<LI>Rather than the simple &quot;are-you-alive?&quot; protocol, a more
complex protocol could be used. For example, if the browser is executing
on a mobile machine which is about to shut down due to low battery power,
it could return the address of another agent during phase 1, to which the
action coordinator should redirect the phase 2 outcome. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Figure 3 shows two transactional gateways, A and B, for the same transactional
newspaper application: users purchase cookies, and their payments are debited
from a bank account which is held elsewhere, possibly by a different organisation.
A purchase operation is required to atomically debit an account <I>and
</I>deliver the purchased cookie to the user. Therefore, the transaction
spans multiple domains and transactional objects. Transaction aware browsers
use gateway B, whereas A is used by non-transactional browsers. As illustrated,
prior to invoking the operation on the newspaper object, A creates a browser
proxy which is registered with the atomic action. During the second phase
of the commit protocol, the proxy transmits the cookie to the browser,
which must acknowledge after storing it on disk; if a failure of either
the browser or server occurs, the cookie will be retransmitted by the crash
recovery mechanisms. Apart from starting and ending transactions, the application
does not have to perform additional work in order to guarantee that the
user's request will be performed despite failures. (In the case of the
transactional browser, the cookie is simply the state of one of the transactional
objects within the browser which were downloaded by B.)</P>

<CENTER><P>Figure 3: Transactional gateways. </P></CENTER>

<P>Another advantage of transactional gateways and browser proxies is that
they can be used to support the construction of modular applications. The
same transactional application can be accessed from the Web and from other
(distributed) environments; only the gateway need change. For example,
in figure 4 the same application has been made available to Web users and
ORB clients [<A HREF="#CORBA">6</A>]. Each gateway is responsible for the
protocol aspects of interfacing the application with the specific distributed
environment.</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="img00006.gif" HEIGHT=173 WIDTH=259> </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Figure 4: Inter-working.</P></CENTER>

<P>Having presented a model for providing lightweight end-to-end transactional
guarantees for Web applications, we shall now describe a system which implements
it.</P>

<H2>W3OTrans </H2>

<P>We have developed the W3OTrans toolkit which provides programmers with
the ability to implement Web applications using atomic actions and objects.
Although we shall concentrate on the support for building transactional
gateways and browser proxies, W3OTrans also supports the following types
of transactional application:</P>

<OL>
<LI>the application executes entirely at the Web server, as the result
of the browsing user selecting a specific URL. </LI>

<LI>the application executes entirely within the browser. </LI>

<LI>the application executes within the browser and the Web server; the
server may contain the more security-sensitive resources, for example.
In this case, the browser is simply another address space for the application.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>Using W3OTrans, programmers can build transactional applications which
span multiple Web servers, multiple browsers, or execute locally within
a single browser. In addition, transactions can span browser invocations,
and can be arbitrarily nested. In order to do this, W3OTrans is implemented
in C++ and Java, enabling server-side applications to take full advantage
of more efficient compilation techniques. However, since all of the W3OTrans
facilities are available in both languages, applications can be written
entirely in Java.</P>

<H3>Impact of the Java security model </H3>

<P>The use of Java to implement the browser-side version of W3OTrans raises
some important security issues. Java security is imposed by a SecurityManager
object, which defines what an applet can, and cannot do [<A HREF="#JAVA">7</A>][<A HREF="#NUTSHELL">8</A>].
Although it is believed that users will eventually be able to provide their
own SecurityManager, currently the Java interpreter provides the only implementation.
As described in [<A HREF="#NUTSHELL">8</A>], generally an applet cannot
remotely communicate with a node other than the one from which it was loaded.
In addition, an applet cannot write to the disk of the machine on which
it is being run. If an applet is loaded directly from the user's disk then
many of these restrictions are relaxed.</P>

<P>However, the problem for Java programmers is that each implementer of
a Java interpreter can provide a different security model and SecurityManager
object, which may impose different constraints. Therefore, to enable applications
written with W3OTrans to execute in any Java-aware Web browser, our two
major premises were not to modify the language or the interpreter. Services
such as persistence and concurrency control are accessed through interfaces
which do not specify an implementation, allowing objects to determine the
required implementation at run-time. For example, an object written using
W3OTrans can choose implementations for persistence based upon the security
restrictions of the Java interpreter, the user's requirements, and the
application, without modifications to the application. For example, where
the SecurityManager prevents applets from accessing the local disk for
persistence, a remote persistence service can be used. </P>

<H3>W3OTrans classes </H3>

<P>W3OTrans is built on the W3Objects system [<A HREF="#W3OBJECTS1">4</A>][<A HREF="#W3OBJECTS2">9</A>].
W3Objects is a framework for the construction of Web applications using
object-oriented techniques. W3Objects are responsible for their own persistence,
concurrency control, fault-tolerance, etc., which are provided through
appropriate classes and libraries. In addition, every W3Object has the
ability to guarantee referential integrity: the object can be prevented
from being deleted as long as a single reference to it exists. W3Objects
are available to standard Web browsers using the HTTP protocol, and can
also possess interfaces which enable them to be invoked using other protocols.
</P>

<P>In keeping with the W3Objects methodology, objects obtain ACID properties
through inheritance. W3OTrans presents programmers with an AtomicObject
base class and the AtomicAction class. The AtomicObject class is responsible
for supporting the properties of serialisability, failure atomicity and
permanence of effect. Concurrency control can be applied on a per object
basis, and uses a multiple reader/single writer policy. Each derived class
must provide methods to convert an object's state to/from a format which
can be saved to stable storage. Therefore, the programmer has explicit
control over which objects, and which parts of an object, are transactional.
</P>

<P>The AtomicAction class is used to create atomic actions. An action is
automatically nested if it is created within the scope of another action.
Whenever an AtomicObject is used within an action it is automatically registered
with that action, i.e., it becomes part of the transactional context and
will be manipulated by the action to guarantee ACID properties. If the
object is in another address space (e.g., on a different machine), then
the action will automatically span these address spaces. This occurs transparently
to the application programmer: there is no special syntax required to ensure
that transactional contexts cross address spaces. </P>

<H3>W3OTrans gateways and proxies </H3>

<P>When building applications which require end-to-end transactional integrity
for the browser but which do not require, or cannot allow, the browser
to contain transactional objects, the programmer can create application
specific transactional gateways and browser proxies. After developing the
transactional application using the W3OTrans classes, the programmer uses
a high-level definition language to specify the required gateway interface,
i.e., the operations which the application supports and wants to export
to the Web. Using this interface definition, W3OTrans tools automatically
generate the server-side transactional gateway and Java code which allows
it to be invoked from a browser applet, along with C++ and Java implementations
of the browser proxy. The gateway is represented in the applet as a Java
class with one method for each operation; each method is responsible for
communicating with the actual server-side gateway. Currently the proxy
protocol is based upon a simple &quot;are-you-alive?&quot; message as described
in the section <B><A HREF="#Transactional gateways and browser">Transactional
gateways and browser proxies</A></B>. The programmer then modifies the
server-side gateway code to begin and end atomic actions, and register
browser proxies. There is no necessity to consider possible failure scenarios
and attempt to perform compensating work: the transactions will automatically
guarantee consistency and integrity. At this stage, the programmer has
a complete server-side transactional application, and can now concentrate
on the non-transactional browser applet, which will allow users to interact
with the application through the gateway.</P>

<H2>Bank ATM example </H2>

<P>Having given an overview of the W3OTrans system, we shall now describe
a bank account application which we have used it to build. The application
presents Web users with the ability to insert, withdraw and inspect their
accounts, which are accessed via a PIN. To preserve consistency in the
presence of failures and concurrent users, the operations are performed
as separate atomic actions. In order that the bank can service concurrent
write operations, each account is a separate transactional object. As shown
in Figure 5, a Java applet displays a graphical representation of a bank
ATM machine. When the user selects an operation, the applet displays a
unique transaction identifier for this operation and then invokes the appropriate
method on the bank gateway.</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="img00007.gif" HEIGHT=420 WIDTH=560></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Figure 5: Bank applet.</P></CENTER>

<P>Although the inspect operation is atomic, it only reads the state of
the account and therefore there is no requirement for end-to-end transactional
integrity: if a failure occurs, the user can simply re-issue the request.
However, both withdrawing and inserting money require stronger transactional
guarantees: each operation must atomically modify the account <I>and </I>cause
the applet to animate either the withdrawing or inserting of money. This
is accomplished by the bank returning a token during the commit protocol
which indicates whether the operation committed or aborted; the applet
uses this to either animate, or print an error message. A failure to perform
the operation may be the rest of insufficient funds, for example, or that
the bank application crashed before debiting the account. As shown in figure
6, during phase 1 of the commit protocol the proxy determines whether the
browser is still available. If the browser responds <I>and</I> the attempt
to debit the user's account can be made permanent, the protocol proceeds
to phase 2 and commits the action, making permanent any changes. During
this phase the browser proxy transmits the token to the applet, which dispenses
the money and acknowledges receipt of the token. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="img00008.gif" HEIGHT=173 WIDTH=259><IMG SRC="img00009.gif" HEIGHT=173 WIDTH=259>
</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Figure 6: Bank Withdraw operation. </P></CENTER>

<P>If the Web server crashes during the action, the user can re-issue the
request when the machine recovers by typing in the transaction identifier.
The crash recovery mechanism at the Web server will determine the transaction
outcome and complete the action. If the browser crashes before the end
of phase 1 it will cause the action to abort. If it crashes after the coordinator
has decided to commit, crash recovery will be responsible for resolving
the action when the browser recovers. Therefore, when withdrawing money,
if the user's bank account is debited the application can guarantee that,
regardless of failures, the money will be dispensed. The programmer can
develop the application without having to consider the possible failure
scenarios and how to provide recovery mechanisms for them.</P>

<H2>Comparisons with other systems </H2>

<P>In this section we shall briefly consider other systems intended to
integrate atomic actions and the Web.</P>

<H3>Transactions through cgi-scripts </H3>

<P>Figure 7 shows how it is possible to use cgi-scripts to allow users
to make use of applications which manipulate atomic resources [<A HREF="#TRANSARC">10</A>]:
the user selects a URL which references a cgi-script on a Web server (message
1), which then performs the action and returns a response to the browser
(message 2) <I>after</I> the action has completed. (Returning the message
during the action is incorrect since the action may not be able to commit
the changes.)</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="img00010.gif" HEIGHT=175 WIDTH=265> </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Figure 7: transactions through cgi-scripts </P></CENTER>

<P>In a failure free environment, this mechanism works well, with atomic
actions guaranteeing the consistency of the server application. However,
in the presence of failures it is possible for message 2 to be lost between
the server and the browser. If the transaction commits, the reply will
be sent after the transaction has ended; therefore, other work performed
within the transaction will have been made permanent. For some applications
this may not be a problem, e.g., where the result is simply confirmation
that the operation has been performed. If the result is a cookie, however,
the loss of the cookie will leave the user without his purchase and money,
and may require the service provider to perform complex procedures to verify
the cookie was lost, invalidate it and issue another.</P>

<H3>Transactions in Java </H3>

<P>There are several groups working on incorporating transactions into
Java [<A HREF="#PJAVA">11</A>][<A HREF="#TRANJAVA">12</A>]. These schemes
are based on providing atomic actions with <I>orthogonal-persistence</I>:
objects are written without requiring knowledge that they may be persistent
or atomic: the Java runtime environment is modified to provide this functionality.
The applet simply starts and ends transactions, and every object which
is manipulated within a transaction will automatically be made atomic.
We consider these approaches unsuitable for Web applications as they suffer
from the following limitations:</P>

<OL>
<LI>They require changes to the Java interpreter and language. Applications
written using these systems will only execute on specialised interpreters.</LI>

<LI>Both schemes assume that the entire application will be written in
Java, and will not be distributed, i.e., it will either execute at the
browser or at the Web server. </LI>
</OL>

<H2>Conclusions and future work </H2>

<P>In this paper we have presented an model for integrating atomic actions
and the Web. Using transactional gateways and browser proxies we have shown
how it is possible for non-transactional browsers to participate within
a transaction. Applications can therefore obtain end-to-end transactional
integrity, guaranteeing consistency in the presence of failures and concurrent
access. The model is lightweight, and does not require the browser to incorporate
support for transactions. We have presented the W3OTrans system which implements
this model, and described an example which we have built using it.</P>

<P>Currently W3OTrans provides support for the automatic construction of
simple browser proxies and gateways. We intend to extend this support to
arbitrary, application specific implementations. W3OTrans transactions
are based upon those provided by the Arjuna system, which is a toolkit
for building fault-tolerant distributed applications in C++ using objects
and actions [<A HREF="#ARJUNA">13</A>]. Arjuna provides a number of fault-tolerance
mechanisms, including object replication [<A HREF="#REPLICATION">14</A>],
which we are investigating providing within the W3OTrans framework. It
is also our intention to make W3OTrans compatible with the commercial standard
for atomic actions, the Object Transaction Service from the OMG [<A HREF="#OTS">2</A>].
This will enable Web applications to interoperate with commercial transactional
applications and objects in other domains. Finally, we are investigating
the Visa and Mastercard work in SET [<A HREF="#SET">15</A>], to determine
how to incorporate the security issues it raises.</P>
