<B>Abstract:</B>
One of most serious problems plaguing the World Wide Web today
is that of broken hypertext links, which are a major annoyance
to browsing users and also a cause of tarnished reputation and
possible loss of opportunity for information providers. The root
of the problem lies in the current Web architecture's lack of
support for referential integrity. This paper presents a model
for the provision of referential integrity for Web resources which
supports resource migration and tolerates site and communication
failures. The approach is object-oriented, highly flexible, completely
distributed, and does not require any global administration. An
attractive feature of our design is the provision of a lightweight
mechanism which provides referential integrity, and which may
be customised on a per resource basis to provide increased fault-tolerance
and performance. Our system follows an evolutionary approach,
supporting parallel operation with the existing Web, allowing
users to gain the additional benefits of referential integrity
while allowing continued access through trusted software components.
