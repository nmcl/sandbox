<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>One of most serious problems plaguing the World Wide Web today is
that of broken hypertext links, which are a major annoyance to
browsing users and also a cause of tarnished reputation and possible
loss of opportunity for information providers. The root of the problem
lies in the current Web architecture's lack of support for referential
integrity. This paper presents a model for the provision of
referential integrity for Web resources which supports resource
migration and tolerates site and communication failures. The approach
is object-oriented, highly flexible, completely distributed, and does
not require any global administration. An attractive feature of our
design is the provision of a lightweight mechanism which provides
referential integrity, and which may be customised on a per resource
basis to provide increased fault-tolerance and performance. Our system
follows an evolutionary approach, supporting parallel operation with
the existing Web, allowing users to gain the additional benefits of
referential integrity while allowing continued access through trusted
software components.</P>
