<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>Caching plays a vital role in the performance of any large-scale
distributed system and, as the variety and number of Web applications
grows, is becoming an increasingly important research topic within the
Web community.  Existing caching mechanisms are largely transparent to
their users and cater for resources which are primarily read-only,
offering little support for customisable or complex caching
strategies. In this paper we examine the deficiencies in these
mechanisms with regard to applications with requirements for shared
access to data where clients may require a variety of consistency
guarantees. We present 'open' caching within an object-oriented
framework, an approach to solving these problems which, instead of
offering caching transparency makes the caching mechanism highly
visible allowing great flexibility in caching choices. Our
implementation is built upon the W3Objects infrastructure and allows
clients to make caching decisions for individual resources with
minimal impact upon other resources which do not support our
mechanisms.</P>
