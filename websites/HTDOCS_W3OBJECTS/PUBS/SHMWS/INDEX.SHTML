<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>This paper focuses on the management aspects of Web service
provision. We argue that support for manageability has to be
considered at the design stage if services are to be capable of
delivering high levels of quality of service for their users. Examples
of the problems caused by lack of manageability include maintenance
operations that necessitate service downtime, or difficulties in
ensuring consistency of information. We categorise management issues
into those concerning a site as a whole and those pertaining to
individual services. Our approach to site management supports the
arbitrary distribution of services to machines, allowing the optimum
cost/performance configuration to be selected. Services can be easily
migrated between machines, resulting in sites that scale, both in
terms of the number of services and the number of users. Service
management issues may be generalised as supporting evolution, for
example, supporting changes to the functionality, the presentation
logic, and the overall look and feel of a service. Our approach, based
on the separation of functionality and presentation, allows such
changes to be performed on-line and ensures that updates are reflected
consistency across the various pages of a service, or across services.
This approach also facilitates the development of services that
utilise dynamic content for service customisations, such as tailoring
a service to match the profile of users. Furthermore, all management
operations are available through Web-based interfaces, making them
accessible to a broad range of users, not only specialist system
administrators.</P>
